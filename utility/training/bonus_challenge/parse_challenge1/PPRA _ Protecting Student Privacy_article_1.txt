Since the enactment of  these regulations in September 1984, there have been significant amendments to section 445 of GEPA by the
No Child Left Behind Act of 2001
(NCLB) passed in 2002, Pub. L. 107-110, and by
Goals 2000:  Educate America Act
, Pub. L. 103-227, passed in 1994.  The regulations do not reflect these most recent amendments to PPRA, and certain provisions in the current regulations are superseded by these statutory amendments.  The current statute can be found at

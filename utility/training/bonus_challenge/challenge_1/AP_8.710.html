<h3><li>University PCI DSS Compliance Process</h3><br />
<ol><li>Background<br />
<ol><li>The PCI SSC set forth PCI DSS, a set of twelve technical and operational requirements to protect cardholder data and reduce credit card fraud.&nbsp; </li><br />
<li>The PCI DSS requirements apply to all organizations that store, process or transmit credit card data, thus, as such an organization, the University is required to comply with PCI DSS.</li><br />
<li>Each University Merchant is required to comply with University policies and procedures and the applicable PCI DSS requirements based on their payment processing method/merchant environment.</li><br />
<li>University policies and procedures and PCI DSS requirements apply to all University Merchant personnel involved with University merchant operations that could affect the security of cardholder data.<br />
</li></ol></li><br />
<li>The SAQ is an annual PCI-mandated attestation intended to demonstrate compliance with PCI DSS.&nbsp; Depending on the payment processing method/ merchant environment, a specific set of PCI DSS requirements are applicable and are detailed in the applicable SAQ.&nbsp; Failure to meet the PCI DSS requirements may increase exposure to fraudulent activity.&nbsp; In addition, failure of the Merchant Account Contact to submit the SAQ on an annual basis will cause the University to be out of compliance.&nbsp;  <br />
<br />

<li>PCI DSS Requirements<br />
<ol><li>PCI DSS is comprised of 6 primary goals with 12 requirements.&nbsp; These goals and requirements were designed to ensure safe-handling of sensitive information related to credit card transactions.&nbsp; The goals and requirements are listed below.&nbsp; To see the complete PCI DSS requirements and additional information on PCI DSS, see the PCI SSC website at:&nbsp; <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/">https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/</a><br />
</li><br />
<u>Goal - Build and Maintain a Secure Network and Systems</u><br />
<b><li>Requirement #1 – Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data</b><br />
Firewalls are devices that control computer traffic allowed between the University’s networks (internal) and untrusted networks (external), as well as traffic into and out of more sensitive areas within an entity’s internal trusted networks. The cardholder data environment is an example of a more sensitive area within an entity’s trusted network.&nbsp; A firewall examines all network traffic and blocks those transmissions that do not meet the University’s specified security criteria.<br />
<br />
All systems must be protected from unauthorized access from untrusted networks, whether entering the system via the Internet as e-commerce, employee Internet access through desktop browsers, employee e-mail access, dedicated connections such as business-to-business connections, via wireless networks, or via other sources. Often, seemingly insignificant paths to and from untrusted networks can provide unprotected pathways into key systems. Firewalls are a key protection mechanism for any computer network.<br />
<br />
Other system components may provide firewall functionality, as long as they meet the minimum requirements for firewalls as defined in this requirement. Where other system components are used within the cardholder data environment to provide firewall functionality, these devices must be included within the scope and assessment of requirement 1.</li><br />
<li><b>Requirement # 2- Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters</b><br />
System components used in sensitive networks often will come with default vendor settings (usernames, passwords, configuration settings, etc.).&nbsp; Vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters must be changed before systems are installed in the secure network environment (cardholder data network).<br />
<br />
Individuals with malicious intent (external and internal to an entity) often use vendor default passwords and other vendor default settings to compromise systems. These passwords and settings are well known by hacker communities and are easily determined via public information.</li><br />
<u>Goal - Protect Cardholder Data</u><br />
<li><b>Requirement #3 – Protect cardholder data</b><br />
All cardholder data must be securely handled and protected against unauthorized use at all times.<br />
<br />
Cardholder data is defined as:<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary Account Number (PAN)<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Card Validation Code (CVV, CVV2, and CVC2)<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit Card Personal Identification Number (PIN)<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any form of magnetic stripe data from the card (Track 1, Track 2)<br />
<br />
It is strictly prohibited to store:<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contents of the payment card magnetic stripe (track data) on any media <br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp; PIN or CVV/CVC on any media<br />
<br />
PAN is to be masked when displayed (first six and last four digits are the maximum number of digits to be displayed). Access to sensitive cardholder information such as PANs is restricted to employees that have a legitimate need to view such information.<br />
<br />
Cardholder data must be protected when stored or in transit over public (or untrusted) networks.&nbsp; Strong industry standard encryption methodologies must be used to protect data stored on hard drives, removable media, backups, etc.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Protection methods such as encryption, truncation, masking, and hashing are critical components of cardholder data protection. If an intruder circumvents other network security controls and gains access to encrypted data, without the proper cryptographic keys, the sensitive data is unreadable and unusable to that person.<br />
<br />
Any sensitive cardholder data that is no longer required for business reasons must be discarded in a secure and irrecoverable manner.</li><br />
<li><b>Requirement #4 – Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks</b><br />
Cardholder data must be encrypted during transmission over networks that are easily accessed by malicious individuals. Misconfigured wireless networks and vulnerabilities in legacy encryption and authentication protocols continue to be targets of malicious individuals who exploit these vulnerabilities to gain privileged access to cardholder data environments.<br />
</li><br />
<u>Goal - Maintain a Vulnerability Program</u><br />
<li><b>Requirement #5 – Protect all systems against malware and regularly update anti-virus software or programs</b><br />
System components within the cardholder data network must be part of an active vulnerability maintenance program.&nbsp; This program will control the existence of malicious software (e.g., anti-virus software) and provide policies covering development efforts and system or software updates/upgrades such that security is maintained. <br />
<br />
Malicious software, commonly referred to as “malware”—including viruses, worms, and Trojans—enters a sensitive network segment during many business approved activities, including employees’ e-mail and use of the Internet, mobile computers, and storage devices, resulting in the exploitation of system vulnerabilities. Anti-virus software must be used on all systems commonly affected by malware to protect systems from current and evolving malicious software threats.</li><br />
<li><b>Requirement #6 – Develop and maintain secure systems and applications</b><br />
Unscrupulous individuals use security vulnerabilities to gain privileged access to systems. Many of these vulnerabilities are fixed by vendor-provided security patches, which must be installed by the entities that manage the systems. All systems must have all appropriate software patches to protect against the exploitation and compromise of cardholder data by malicious individuals and malicious software.<br />
<br />
Note: Appropriate software patches are those patches that have been evaluated and tested sufficiently to determine that the patches do not conflict with existing security configurations.</li><br />
<u>Goal - Implement Strong Access Control Measures</u><br />
<li><b>Requirement #7 – Restrict access to cardholder data by business need to know</b><br />
Access to system components and software within the cardholder data network must be controlled and restricted to those with a business need for that access.&nbsp; This is achieved using active access control systems, strong controls on user and password management, and restricting physical access to critical or sensitive components and software to individuals with a “need to know.”<br />
<br />
Systems and processes must be in place to limit access to critical data and systems based on an individual’s need to know and according to job responsibilities.<br />
<br />
Need to know is when access rights are granted to the least amount of data and privileges needed to perform a job.</li><br />
<li><b>Requirement #8 - Identify and authenticate access to system components</b><br />
It is critical to assign a unique identification (ID) to each person with access to critical systems or software. This ensures that each individual is uniquely accountable for his or her actions. When such accountability is in place, actions taken on critical data and systems are performed by, and can be traced to, known and authorized users.</li><br />
<li><b>Requirement #9 – Restrict physical access to cardholder data</b><br />
Media is defined as any printed or handwritten paper, received faxes, external storage or back-up tapes, computer hard drive, etc.&nbsp; Media containing sensitive cardholder information must be handled and distributed in a secure manner.&nbsp;  Strict control must be maintained over the external or internal distribution of any media containing cardholder data and over the storage and accessibility of media.&nbsp; The transportation of media containing sensitive cardholder data to another location must be authorized by appropriate personnel, logged and inventoried before leaving the premises.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Any physical access to data or systems that house cardholder data provide the opportunity for individuals to access devices or data and to remove systems or hardcopies, and should be appropriately restricted.<br />
<br />
Visitors must always be escorted by an employee in areas that hold sensitive cardholder information.<br />
<br />
Disposal of cardholder data:<br />
<ol><li>All data must be securely disposed of when no longer required, regardless of the media on which it is stored</li><br />
<li>Hard copy materials must be crosscut shredded or incinerated such that they cannot be reconstructed</li><br />
<li>All cardholder data on electronic media must be rendered unrecoverable when deleted</li><br />
<li>All cardholder information awaiting destruction must be held in lockable storage containers and access to these containers must be restricted</li></ol></li><br />
<u>Goal - Regularly Monitor and Test Networks</u><br />
<li><b>Requirement #10 – Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data</b><br />
Logging mechanisms and the ability to track user activities are critical in preventing, detecting, or minimizing the impact of a data compromise. The presence of logs in all environments allows thorough tracking, alerting, and analysis when something does go wrong. Determining the cause of a compromise is very difficult without system activity logs.&nbsp; Detailed monitoring procedures should be developed and documented.</li><br />
<b><li>Requirement #11 – Regularly test security systems and processes</b><br />
Vulnerabilities are continually being discovered in current, and introduced by new software. System components, processes, and custom software must be tested frequently to ensure security controls continue to reflect a changing environment. Detailed testing procedure should be developed and documented.</li><br />
<u>Goal - Maintain an Information Security Policy</u><br />
<strong><li>Requirement #12 – Maintain a policy that addresses information security for all personnel</strong><br />
Consistent policies and procedures are required to be practiced and followed at all times.<br />
<br />
All employees should be aware of the sensitivity of data and their responsibilities for protecting it.&nbsp; The University’s information security policy and procedures apply to all employees (full-time, part-time, casual hires, student employees) and others (i.e. volunteers) that work within the University’s cardholder data environment.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If cardholder data is shared with a 3rd party Service Provider:<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A list of such Service Providers must be maintained.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall be a written agreement with the Service Provider.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Service Provider shall be monitored for PCI DSS compliance.<br />
<br />
If a merchant department believes it may have a breach of cardholder information or of systems related to the PCI environment, refer to Appendix C for University’s PCI Incident Response Plan Guidelines.</li></ol></li><br />

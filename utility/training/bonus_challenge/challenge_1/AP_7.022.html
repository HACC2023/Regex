&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  b. Receive an explanation and interpretation of the content of such records;<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  c. Receive a copy of the records if failure to provide a copy would prevent the student from exercising the right of inspection.<br />

These disclosures may include, for example, athletic team rosters, graduation programs, University press releases, or similar publications initiated by the University for University purposes. Specific directory information about an individual student will not be released to the public if the student has affirmatively informed the University that he or she does not want any or all of those types of information about himself or herself designated as directory information. The procedures for an individual student to “opt” out of disclosure is set forth in the following section III-F-4.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. In general, lists or compilations of directory information will not be made available to third parties solely upon third party requests to the University.<br />

<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;  4. A student presently registered and in attendance at any campus may, at any time, request that all items designated as directory information not be disclosed to the public, i.e., they may opt out of disclosure.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  a. A student wishing to exercise this right must submit in person, and with appropriate identification, FERPA Form 2, “Request to Opt out of Directory Information,” to the Custodian of Education Records.

If the form is received after the above stated periods, then no information will be released after the form is processed, which will be no later than two working days after the form is received.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  b. Should a student decide to exercise the right to withhold directory information, the University will not release that information to non-University persons or organizations. The decision to withhold directory information should be carefully considered as it may affect the University’s ability to respond on behalf of a student, such as for a request for verification of enrollment by prospective employers.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  c. A student may rescind the request for non-disclosure of directory information at any time by completing the bottom section of FERPA Form 2 and submitting it to the Custodian of Education Records.

<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  b. University Officials with a legitimate educational interest may access educational records as part of their job duties and responsibilities. Authorized representatives under specific conditions may also access educational records without student consent. Refer to sections I and J for more information.<br />

 <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  (1) Release of education records to contractors, consultants, volunteers, or other parties will require a contract or written agreement following the terms of the University’s data sharing policy.&nbsp; For example, for organizations such as the National Student Clearinghouse (or an organization contracted by the University to handle student loan verification), a contract or written agreement will be required which specifies what information will be released, and how the organization will use and protect the information.<br />

Question: How do I import events (iCal format) into Google@UH Calendar?
Article Text: You can find instructions on importing events into Google@UH Calendar at this web page: http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=37118 Notes: Step 1 says to click on the "Add" down-arrow button. There is more than one "Add" link. Click on the Add link that is shown in the image below. If you are importing multiple calendars, and you wish to keep these calendars separate, you must create a new calendar for each calendar you wish to import before importing the calendar's events. For example, if you had an account with a "Work" calendar, and you wish to import this calendar into a new account, you must create another "Work" calendar in the new account before you do the import. Please see article http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1153 for more information on creating a new calendar.

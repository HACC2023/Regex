Question: Creating/Importing Quiz Questions in Laulima via copy and paste from a Word document
Article Text: The Tests & Quizzes tool allows for the import (copy and paste from a Word document) of test questions. Types of questions that can be imported include multiple-choice, true-false, fill-in-the-blank, short essay, and multiple-choice with more than one correct answer. Questions can then be imported into the Tasks, Tests and Surveys tool if you do not want to use the Tests & Quizzes tool. This is a tutorial that can help guide you through this process: http://www.hawaii.edu/talent/get_started/laulima/test/createquizquestions.html (this tutorial opens in another window)

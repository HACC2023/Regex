Question: How Can I Access LISTSERV?
Article Text: You can perform actions in LISTSERV by sending a command through email or using the Web interface. Some commands are only available to LISTSERV administrators and list owners while other commands are available to subscribers and non-subscribers as well. Using Email to Communicate with LISTSERV There are two main email addresses that are used to work with LISTSERV lists. One is to communicate with the LISTSERV program — a “command address.” The other is used to post mail to the list — the “list address.” If you want to change a list configuration or subscription setting, you would email listserv@lists.hawaii.edu. If you want to post a message to the list, you would email the list address (ex: examplelist-l@lists.hawaii.edu). Using the Web Interface to Communicate with LISTSERV Sending email messages containing commands to LISTSERV and posting messages to the list is sometimes confusing for people who are new to mailing lists. To simplify this process, the Web interface provides a centralized location for interaction with LISTSERV. You can use the Web interface to issue commands directly to LISTSERV and post simple messages to the list. To access the Web interface, visit https://listserv.hawaii.edu/ and sign in using your email address (example@hawaii.edu). First time users must submit an account request by registering a password.

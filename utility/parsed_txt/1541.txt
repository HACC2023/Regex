Question: Eduroam Wireless for UH Manoa
Article Text: The University of Hawai‘i is a member of the eduroam community of research and education institutions who share network resources among its users by allowing visitors access to its campus Wi-Fi. UH faculty, staff, and students who visit other participating universities—U.S. and worldwide—can use their own UH username and password to log in and access the Internet. While it takes a little bit of setup beforehand (see setup instructions below), it avoids having to request a guest account or pay for Internet access while visiting another institution. Please note: University of Hawai‘i users must be at a remote participating campus to connect to the eduroam Wi-Fi SSID, or Network Name. If you are a UH user on a local UH campus, you must connect to the regular campus network SSID (e.g., UHM) and use your regular username and password to log in.

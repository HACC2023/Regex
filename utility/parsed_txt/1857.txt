Article Text: These instructions are only for users who have received an email from Google with subject "Prevent your Brand Accounts deletion" or "Brand Account suspension" AND have already contacted the ITS Help Desk in preparation to migrate a brand account youtube channel to YouTube Studio. Note that only the primary owner of the Brand Account can migrate YouTube channels to YouTube Studio, and migrating channels will replace the existing channel of the Google Account migrated to.

Click on the avatar on the upper right, click on Switch account, then select the Brand Account YouTube channel. Click on the avatar on the upper right (the brand account name and avatar should be displayed), and click on Settings. Under Settings on the left, click on Advanced settings. Click on Move channel to your Google Account or to a different brand account. Under Choose an account to move this channel to, click on REPLACE corresponding to the primary owner of the brand account. On the popup, check the box "I understand and wish to proceed", then click on DELETE CHANNEL. On the following confirmation screen, click on MOVE CHANNEL. (migration of the channels may take 10+ minutes)

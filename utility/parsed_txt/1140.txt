Question: Gradebook calculations in Laulima - students grades are not calculating properly
Article Text: Currently, the gradebook does not include gradebook items that have not been graded in the course grade calculation. This could result in a higher course grade for a student. To include a gradebook item in the course grade calculation, you must enter a grade of zero or higher. You can either enter in zeros through out the semester. Or if at the end of the semester many of the students have not turned in assignments or completed quizzes, the "Calculate Course Grades" function in the Gradebook can automatically input zeros for all missing grades. This tutorial can help guide you through the process: http://www.hawaii.edu/talent/laulimatutorials/laulima_coursegrades.htm (link opens in new window)

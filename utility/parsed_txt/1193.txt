Question: How Do I Delete a Google@UH Drive document?
Article Text: Deleting a document From the Drive document list, select the document by placing a checkmark, then click on Remove . Alternatively, after selecting the document by placing a checkmark, you can click on More, then Remove. Select the Trash folder and click on Empty trash to permanently delete any docs in your Trash folder. Additional Considerations If you are not the owner of a document, you may still remove the doc from your list, however it will not be shown in the Trash folder. If you are the owner and sharing a document, upon deletion the document will be completely removed from Drive for all collaborators, and they will no longer have access to the document. Before deleting a document, you may want to make someone else its owner so that your collaborators can still access it.

Question: NIH "login.gov" account signup required by Sep 15 to use services
Article Text: The Federal Government is rolling out a centralized portal, login.gov, to provide secure access to all government agencies through a single username/password with two-factor authentication. Users of eRA Commons, ASSIST, and other NIH services (including NIH RePORTER) will need to set up a login.gov account by September 15, 2021. Your UH credentials will no longer be compliant with NIH requirements as of this date. Current eRA and ASSIST accounts can be linked to new login.gov accounts. See NIH Notice NOT-OD-21-040 and login.gov for more information and instructions on how to set up an account.

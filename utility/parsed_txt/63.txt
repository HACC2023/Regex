Question: Hard Drive Recovery
Article Text: ITS offers basic hard drive recovery services. You may bring your bad hard drive (the bad hard drive must be taken out of the PC or enclosure) and some type of blank media (another hard drive or a large capacity USB thumb drive) to either the IT Center Service Window or the Hamilton Library CLIC Lab. Hard drive recoveries take a minimum of five working days to complete and we cannot make any guarantees that your data will be recovered.

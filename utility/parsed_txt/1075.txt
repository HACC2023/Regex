Question: Common Tasks Using Email
Article Text: If you are used to using email to make changes to your list, you can continue to do so. To issue commands to LISTSERV, compose an email to listserv@lists.hawaii.edu with a blank subject line. The body of the message should contain only commands to LISTSERV with one command per line. Lines containing non-commands will result in an error message being returned. Be careful not to include your signature in your email if you have one set up, as LISTSERV will attempt to interpret the signature text as commands and return “Invalid command” errors. Below are some common commands you can issue via email: To obtain a listing of all the public mailing lists on the UH server: list To add a subscriber to a list (for list owners): add history150-l jdoe@hawaii.edu Jane Doe To delete a subscriber from a list (for list owners): delete history150-l jdoe@hawaii.edu Getting Help: help

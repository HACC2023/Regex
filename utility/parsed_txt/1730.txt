Question: MyUH Retirement
Article Text: MyUH will be retired on April 4, 2017 and replaced by the new MyUH Services. Using the new MyUH is as easy as: Search, Click, Done! Most of the time you won't even have to search. The system is smart enough to show you the most popular tasks that are currently in use. So during registration, for example, registration(STAR), class listings and other tasks that are heavily used at the moment will filter to the top of the MyUH page making it easier for you to find what you need! To help with this transition a list of the popular links from MyUH is presented below in the new MyUH Services format: Table of Contents Tasks for everyone Tasks for students Tasks for faculty Tasks for staff Service Centers Submit a service For everyone Gmail Search for "Gmail" or go directly to http://gmail.hawaii.edu Laulima Search for "Laulima" or go directly to https://laulima.hawaii.edu For students Registration(registration/add/drop) Search for "STAR" or go to directly to https://www.star.hawaii.edu Student Payments & Financial Resources Search payments or go directly to: http://www.hawaii.edu/student-payments-and-financial-resources/ View My Financial Aid Information Search for "view my financial aid" or go directly to: http://go.hawaii.edu/Igj For faculty Search for Faculty Services or go directly to: http://go.hawaii.edu/jgl For staff Search for Employee Resources or go directly to: https://myuh.hawaii.edu/collection/all/employeeresources Service Centers The new portal has Service Centers that group related services together for your convenience.

Question: Common List Configuration Settings
Article Text: Simple Mail Redirect (Mail Alias) Description: This configuration simulates a mail alias. A message posted to the list is simply forwarded to all subscribers. Messages sent to the list are not archived or kept on the server. Subscription to this list is restricted and requires the owner’s approval; however, anyone may post to the list.

Additionally, all files uploaded to Google@UH Drive (except videos) are encrypted while stored on Google's servers. Note, however, that when you provide access to a file or folder in Google Drive to another person, that person has access to the unencrypted data. Therefore, it is critical that you carefully maintain the list of users and groups that your file and folders are shared with in Drive to ensure that unintended audiences can't view or edit your data. Furthermore, the data encryption described here and in use with the Drive service does not imply a sufficient level of security to be used for confidential or personally identifiable information (PII).

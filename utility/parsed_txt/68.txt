Question: I just moved into my office and my wired network is not working. How do I activate my data jack?
Article Text: Call ITS Telecom at 808-956-6033 to verify if your datajack is active. Before calling, you will need to the know the data jack number (the number is on a silver sticker on the data jack). If the datajack is not active, please make arrangments through the ITS Telecom to get your datajack activated. If you are in need of a network cable to connect your computer, phone, or other equipment to a UH data jack, please contact the ITS Help Desk.

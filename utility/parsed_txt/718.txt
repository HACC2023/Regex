For more detailed information about "Securing Your Desktop Computer", please read: http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/593 Protecting Your Information: Do not reply to unsolicited (spam) email. Use free web-based email addresses (Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.) when subscribing to email lists to minimize the amount of spam email you might recieve on your primary email account. Do not give out personal information (address, SSN, passwords, etc.) in response to unsolicited requests. Protect your passwords. Encrypt or password-protect files that contain personal, confidential information such as tax return files, online banking information, etc. Use the built-in encryption capabilities of your operating system or use other third party products such as GPG (http://www.gnupg.org/download/index.en.html). As of 5/29/14, ITS is no longer suggesting TrueCrypt as an encryption method.

We will also never ask you to put your username or password in a URL to request an email quota increase or for any other service enhancement.

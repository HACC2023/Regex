Question: Why is our LISTSERV list not publicly listed?
Article Text: To display your list on the main page, you will need to change the "Confidential" setting. From the home page, click on "Log In" in the top-right corner and sign in using your email address and LISTSERV password. Under "List Management" on the left, select "List Configuration" followed by "Show All Keywords". On the List Configuration page, first select the list that you are modifying. Then, scroll down and click on "Confidential". Note: If you only own one list, it will be selected by default. Using the drop-down menu, select "Service" and click on "Update". (Selecting "No" will also cause the list to be displayed on the L-Soft Global Lists) Note: Use of the confidential setting does not safeguard your list other than removing/displaying your list on the index of lists. To check if your list is visible, click on "Subscriptions" in the “Subscriber Options” menu. Then, click “Customize Report”, select “Show All Lists” from the drop-down menu, and click “Update”.

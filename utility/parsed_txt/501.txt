Question: ITS Data Backup Policy
Article Text: The following information is provided to help users of Information Technology Services (ITS) systems understand the nature of the ITS backup procedures and the availability of information beyond the date on which it is deleted by the users. ITS backs up user’s files to ensure the ability to recover from a scenario where the original content is destroyed. The backups are sent to a remote location to protect against a disaster to the facilities that house the original data. Backups are run on a daily basis, and retained for 23 days. Each daily backup saves the contents of files and directories at the time that the backup was performed. Therefore, the backups do not record all changes to the file’s content throughout the day. It is possible for a file to be created and deleted during the course of a day, and never get backed up. IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING EMAIL: https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1197

Question: Why is Google@UH Gmail showing the wrong date or time on messages?
Article Text: Some users have reported seeing the wrong date and/or time on the Google@UH Gmail web client (http://gmail.hawaii.edu). Users should verify that their date and time are correctly set for their computer by using the instructions at http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1431 . If the date, time, and time zone is correctly set, use the following instructions to attempt to correct the issue: Log into Google@UH Gmail at http://gmail.hawaii.edu. Change the time zone of your operating system to something other than Hawaii (for example Pacific Time). Refresh your browser window by hitting F5 (PC) or Command-R (Mac). Your emails should now display the correct date/time for the time zone you selected. Change the time zone back to Hawaii Standard Time and refresh your browser again. The date and time should now be correct. Note: Due to the way Google Chrome works, Chrome users may need to quit and re-open their browser window while the time zone is changed.

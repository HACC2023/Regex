Question: I currently own a LISTSERV list. How do I change the owner?
Article Text: From the home page, click on "Log In" in the top-right corner and sign in using your email address and LISTSERV password. Under "List Management" on the left, select "List Configuration". Then, select the "Administrators" tab. On the List Configuration page, select the list that you are modifying from the drop-down menu below "Select List". Note: If you only own one list, it will be selected by default. Enter the email address(es) of the new owner(s) with one address per line, review the address(es) entered for typos, and click on "Update" when done. Any owner listed under "Quiet:" will have list management rights, but will not receive any delivery error or administrative mail from LISTSERV. Note: 1) If you are removing yourself as an owner, once you click on submit you will immediately lose access to manage the list. Be sure this is what you want to do! 2) Only a LISTSERV site administrator can add other lists as owners of a list.

Question: How to defer Windows 10 upgrades
Article Text: Note: This deferral feature is no longer available starting with Windows 10 version 2004. This deferral process is available only on PCs running business and education editions, such as Windows 10 Pro, Windows 10 Enterprise, and Windows 10 Education. Windows 10 Home does not offer any deferral options. To defer Windows upgrades, Go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update, then click Advanced options. Option 1 allows you to choose a servicing channel. The default setting is Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted)which means the update is ready for most people. You can change this setting to Semi-Annual Channel which defers feature updates until Microsoft declares them "ready for widespread use in organizations." Option 2 allows you to specify additional time after the official release to the channel you selected. You can delay the upgrade by up to an additional 365 days from its initial release date. Option 3 works independently of the feature update settings and allows you to defer the monthly cumulative security updates and any additional out-of-band updates by up to 30 days.

Question: May I pick any name for my first.last email alias?
Article Text: You may have only one first.last email alias active at any one time. The first.last email alias should be closely related to your full name. The following are guidelines for selecting your first.last email alias: first.last first.last.generation first.m.last first.m.last.generation first.middle.last first.middle.last.generation middle.last middle.last.generation Your first.last email alias may only use alphabets (a-z), dash and/or period. The first.last email alias is not case-sensitive so Jane.Doe@hawaii.edu is the same as jane.doe@hawaii.edu. The "last" part of your selected first.last email alias must reflect your legal last name on record, so if your last name is Doe, Doe must be the "last" part of your first.last email alias. Offensive language will not be allowed in your first.last email alias even if it spells out your name. Alternative first.last email alias combinations can be considered. Name Changes and First.Last Alias If your name has changed, you have the option to switch from the first.last email alias that was based on your previous name, and activate a new first.last email alias based on your new name. For example, Jane Doe has Jane.Doe@hawaii.edu but they have changed their name to Jane Smith. They can choose to activate Jane.Smith@hawaii.edu (if it is available) and their Jane.Doe@hawaii.edu alias would be removed.

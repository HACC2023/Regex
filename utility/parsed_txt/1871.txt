Question: Virtual Server: Dual-Homed to Single-Homed Network Conversion (Windows)
Article Text: SUMMARY: In the past, virtual servers were provisioned with both a public and a private network ("dual-homed"). ITS will be removing the use to the private network, and self-managed VM customers will need to complete the following steps to remove the private network on their server. NOTE: You should contact itscs@hawaii.edu at least 1-2 business days before you plan this, as modifying the private network may cause a downtime to other services or hosts that your server connects to. ITS may also need to modify additional firewall rules on your VM, so if you have critical services that need to be up, it is best that you coordinate this with us ahead of time. Go the the Control Panel on the server and edit the public network interface, which should have a 128.171.*.* IP address. Change the DNS servers to the following: 192.168.10.115 192.168.10.116 Open the command prompt (cmd) to remove the static routes that were set up on the server. Run "netstat -r" to confirm the following routes show: Enter the following commands to remove each route: route -p delete 10.0.0.0 route -p delete 172.16.0.0 route -p delete 192.168.0.0 Go back to the Control Panel and disable the private network interface, which should have an IP of 172.17.*.* Email itscs@hawaii.edu that you have disabled the private network and removed the static routes. We will then remove the NIC from the VM, and modify additional firewall rules on our end if needed. Please note that if the server needs to connect to critical services, this part may not work unless we modify the firewall rules. Therefore, it would be best if we are contacted during business hours to ensure this is completed. RELATED ARTICLES: Virtual Server: Dual-Homed to Single-Homed Network Conversion (Linux)

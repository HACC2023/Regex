Question: Why do I get a warning when sharing a Google Drive file to a non hawaii.edu user?
Article Text: If Google has flagged your Google Drive file(s) as potentially containing personally identifiable information (PII) such as Social Security Numbers or driver's license numbers, the share button appearance changes to include a shield and you will also see a warning when sharing the flagged file to an external (non hawaii.edu) user. Standard share button: changes to: Users receive the warning on sharing to an external user: “This document contains United States - Social Security Number/Driver’s License. The following recipients are outside the item’s domain: xxx@xxxxxx.xxx. Are you sure you would like to share it with external users?” If the file does not contain PII, ignore the warning and continue by clicking "Yes" when prompted. If you remove the PII from the file, it may take up to 24 hours for the file to become unflagged.

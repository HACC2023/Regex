Question: Laulima: Incomplete course enrollments / Laulima student list does not match the Banner list / Missing Courses
Article Text: Faculty: If you find differences between your banner enrollments as displayed in MyUH and laulima enrollments, please click on the "Request Assistance" link at the bottom of every Laulima page to request a sync of your course. This will start a process to add all enrolled students into your course. Students/Faculty: Courses are generally available to students one week prior to the start of the semester. If you are a student or faculty and find that you are missing course tabs in Laulima (and they are not in "My Active Sites"), there may be an issue with your account preventing the system from updating your account with your current courses. If this is the case, please click on the "Request Assistance" link at the bottom of every Laulima page so we can verify/repair your account.

Question: Spirion Actions: Shred, Redact, Encrypt, and Quarantine
Article Text: After scanning a device and Spirion finds potential matches for sensitive or private data, you are given the ability to perform four actions: Shred, Redact, Encrypt, and Quarantine. Below is an explanation of what each action does. Shred Choosing Shred will delete the entire file found to have sensitive data using the U.S. Department of Defense deletion standard, known as DOD 5220.22-M. Shredded files CANNOT be recovered. Shred works on all file types. Redact Choosing Redact will attempt to replace the highlighted data from the Preview Pane with a string of x characters. This will keep all other data in the file intact. Redact has been tested to work on .txt, .docx, .pptx, .xlsx, and .csv files. Encrypt Choosing Encrypt will attempt to encrypt the file using its associated application first. For example, if the file is a PDF, Spirion will attempt to encrypt the file using the PDF standard. The entire file will be encrypted, leaving the data unreadable until decrypted. If successful, your Spirion Profile password is required to unlock and view the file. The file will remain encrypted after each viewing. If that fails, Spirion will store the selected file in a "Spirion Vault File", which requires the user's profile password to decrypt. The Entire file will be encrypted, leaving the data unreadable until decrypted. Performing an decryption does so permanently, not temporarily. You will need to encrypt the file again manually after each decryption. Encrypt works on all file types. Quarantine Choosing Quarantine will move the file to a "quarantined location" and shred it from its original location. You will be asked to select the quarantine location in a pop-up menu. Note: This will NOT shred, redact, or encrypt the data in any way. This just moves the data to another location. The sensitive data will still be accessible in the file. Quarantine works on all file types.

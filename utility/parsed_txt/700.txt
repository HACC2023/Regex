Question: Server Side Includes (SSI)
Article Text: Server Side Includes (SSI) is a simple interpreted server-side scripting language used for webpages. The most common use of SSI is to include the contents of one or more files that are hosted on a web server into a single webpage. To include the contents from another file in your page, insert the following code: <!--#include virtual="path/includename"--> Where path = the path to your file and includename = the name of the file you want to include. For personal homepages, here is a syntax example: <!--#include virtual="/~username/text.txt"--> The file "text.txt" is in the public_html directory. The page that contains the above line must have the executable permission set for world. Issue the 'chmod' command at the unix prompt: chmod a+x filename.html

Question: Why doesn't my LISTSERV list deliver mail anymore? Or LISTSERV reports that the list is held?
Article Text: This can happen if the list has exceeded its daily message threshold. By default, this value is set to 50. Once the daily threshold is met, the list will stop delivering emails until a free command is issued. Freeing The List A list owner will need to compose an email to listserv@lists.hawaii.edu with a blank subject line and the following text in the message body: free listname Note: Do not include "@lists.hawaii.edu" at the end of the listname Alternately, the list owner can log into https://listserv.hawaii.edu, click on LISTSERV Command, select the relevant list from the drop-down menu, input the above command (i.e. free listname), and click on Submit. Increasing the Daily-Threshold In the event that this limit is frequently reached, the list owner may also consider increasing the Daily-Threshold value to prevent the list from being held again. Log in to https://listserv.hawaii.edu. Under the List Management options in the navigation pane on the left, select List Configuration. Click on the Subscriptions tab. Scroll down to Daily-Threshold and enter the desired value into the corresponding field. Click on Update.

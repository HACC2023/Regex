Question: How are non-PO payments (i.e., direct payments) processed?
Article Text: Non-PO payments (e.g., AFPs, stipends, mileage, etc) will be processed similar to the current eAFP process in ePurchasing. Information will be entered on a Disbursement Voucher (DV) by the campus field user. Any necessary supporting documentation will be uploaded and attached to the DV. The DV will be routed to Disbursing for review and approval. Certain attachments with sensitive data (SSN, Credit Card Numbers, etc.) will be sent to Disbursing instead of scanning and attaching to the DV eDoc since the attachments can be viewed by others.

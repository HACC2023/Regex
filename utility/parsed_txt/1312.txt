Question: UH Device Registration Program
Article Text: Annual Device Registration Requirements All servers (such as email, web, FTP, or other file services) operating on the University of Hawaiʻi network must be: Reported in the Device Registration database Continually scanned and remediated for vulnerabilities and missing patches (at a minimum, annually) Scanned for Personally Identifiable Information (PII) which includes Social Security Numbers, Driver's License Numbers and/or credit card or bank account information on a regular basis (at a minimum, annually) If the server does contain PII, it must be reported, as required by HRS §487N Note: Devices that are not registered, scanned and remediated will not be permitted to operate on the UH Network. ITS will proactively seek out active servers throughout the UH network by performing network and vulnerability scans. ITS will attempt to provide warning before blocking unregistered active servers that are found. As a new requirement, Endpoints (Desktops or Laptops) that process sensitive or regulated data must also be registered in the Device Registration site and a Personal Information Survey must be completed. 2023 Device Registration must be completed by September 22, 2023 Registration is considered "completed" when all information is filled out and scan dates are between 1/1/2023 - 09/22/2023. Requirements for Registering a Server The Device Registration database can be accessed here: https://www.hawaii.edu/its/device/registration/. For instructions on how to navigate the Device Registration database visit our AskUs article: https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1748 To complete the registration for your server, you will need to: Verify any information about currently registered servers Perform a vulnerability scan of your server Scanning can be performed using the ScanUH vulnerability scanning service https://scanuh.hawaii.edu/scanner Remediate/patch any vulnerabilities discovered Scan for Personally Identifiable Information (PII) If found, fill out a UH Annual Personal Information Survey Enter the dates scanned in your device registration record, and acknowledge the terms Requirements for Registering an Endpoint The Device Registration database can be accessed here: https://www.hawaii.edu/its/device/registration/. For instructions on how to navigate the Device Registration database visit our AskUs article: https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1748 To complete the registration for your endpoint, you will need to: Verify any information about currently registered endpoints Acknowledge the terms Complete the Personal Information Survey for your data repository. See https://www.hawaii.edu/its/information/survey/ PII Scanning: The University of Hawaii has licensed Spirion https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1297, a software product for Windows and Macintosh systems, to search for social security numbers, credit card numbers, birthdates, driver’s license numbers, etc. If you have a UNIX/Linux system, you will need to use another utility: Find_SSN: http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1323. Another option is to mount the UNIX/Linux filesystem on a Window or Mac system. From there you can run Spirion, and have it scan the mounted filesystem. If Spirion or Find_SSN detects PII: Per Hawaii State Law and UH Policy, if your server contains a repository of PII, it must be reported using the UH Annual Personal Information Survey located at: https://www.hawaii.edu/its/information/survey/. (You will be required to login with your UH username and password.) Vulnerability Scanning: To scan for vulnerabilities, use the ScanUH vulnerability scanning system. It can be found at: https://scanuh.hawaii.edu. You must remediate all critical vulnerabilities before completing your server registration.

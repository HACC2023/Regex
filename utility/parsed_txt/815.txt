Question: DMCA Takedown Procedures at UH
Article Text: A Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) infringement notice (also known as a DMCA takedown notice) is sent to the University when unauthorized copyrighted materials are found by copyright owners and/or their agents. The takedown notice includes the IP number found to be distributing copyrighted materials, date and time of the infringement and a list of items being infringed upon (see a sample DMCA takedown notice). Upon receipt of a DMCA take down notice, Information Technology Services will investigate and if the reported IP number can be linked to a computer and/or UH username, the suspected computer will be blocked immediately from accessing the University of Hawaii's network. This is done to preserve the University of Hawaii's "safe harbor" status as provided in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. The infringing user will be required to meet with a University official before being unblocked and allowed back on to the University's network. If the infringing user is identified, AND IT IS THEIR FIRST OFFENSE, he/she will be informed that: unauthorized downloading and distribution of copyrighted materials is illegal and in violation of UH policy all unauthorized copies of any copyrighted materials must be removed immediately any subsequent violations of E2.210 and/or federal copyright laws will be result in the incident being referred to the appropriate University judiciary authority for further action If the user is a UH faculty or staff member, their department is notified. If the user is a student in the residence halls, ResNet administrators are notified. Any user found to be participating in copyright infringement activities will be notified that such activities are illegal and in violation of UH Executive Policy E2.210: Use and Management of Information Technology Resources and the user will be required to digitally sign a Copyright Notification Letter. Upon digital submission of the Copyright Notification Letter, Information Technology Services will determine if network access can be restored for the affected user or device(s).

Question: ITS Requirements for Government Issued Photo ID
Article Text: The ITS Help Desk may ask for a copy of a government issued photo ID in order to identify a user when processing certain requests. Requests that require a copy of a government issued photo ID for verification include, but are not limited to password resets or removal of DUO Multi-factor Authentication. As a government issued photo ID will contain Personally Identifiable Information, in order to protect the identities of our users it is necessary to send that information securely and as instructed by the ITS Help Desk. Requirements for Government Issued Photo ID When asked to provide a copy of a government issued photo ID, the ID must: Be government issued Be valid (not expired, revoked, etc.) Contain a photograph Contain date of birth Contain the full legal name Preferably be in English Be in legible condition Not be altered or edited in any way If the required information is located on both the front and back of the ID please be sure to send the ITS Help Desk a copy of both sides of the ID. If any of the required information is missing or if the copy is illegible upon receipt, the ID may be rejected and you may be asked to provide another copy of a legible and acceptable ID before the ITS Help Desk can process your request. Common Examples of Acceptable Government Issued Photo IDs The following are common examples of IDs that will fulfill the requirements listed above: Driver's License State ID Passport Please note that these are just the most common forms of identification and that they are not the only types of IDs the ITS Help Desk will accept. Any ID that satisfies the requirements stated above will be accepted. Common Examples of Unacceptable Photo IDs The following are common examples of photo IDs that may not be accepted as they often do not contain the required information: School ID Military ID that does not contain date of birth Library Card ID or keycard that does not contain a photo or date of birth Non-government issued ID, such as a workplace ID or badge If you have any questions please contact the ITS Help Desk by email at help@hawaii.edu or by phone at (808) 956-8883 or toll-free from neighbor islands at (800) 558-2669.

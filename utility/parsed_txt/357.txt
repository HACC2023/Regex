Question: How do I determine my MAC address in Windows?
Article Text: The Media Access Control (MAC) address is a unique 12-digit hexadecimal number assigned to the network interface (e.g. ethernet card) in your network-enabled device. The MAC address is also called the physical (or hardware) address of your network card. There is a different MAC address for the ethernet (wired) and wireless network interfaces. Note: Your wireless will need to be enabled in order to locate your MAC address. If you are not sure how to enable wireless on your device please refer to the instructions that came with your device. For Windows 10 & 11 Press Windows key and R key. Type cmd in search bar. Click Ok or press enter. In the command prompt box, type ipconfig /all, then press Enter. Look for the MAC address under the appropriate section: Ethernet Adapter Ethernet (for wired) and Wireless LAN adapter (for wireless). Your MAC Address (12-digit hexadecimal number) will be listed next to Physical Address. Your IP Address (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) will be listed next to IPv4 Address.

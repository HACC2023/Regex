Question: Hawaiian Diacritics
Article Text: Overview On June 12, 1992, Governor Waihe‘e signed a bill relating to the Hawaiian language that essentially authorizes and encourages the use of macrons and glottal stops whenever words or terms in the Hawaiian language are used in documents prepared by or for state or county agencies and officials. Requested for the Hawaiian language faculty by Dr. Emily Hawkins, assistant Professor of Indo-Pacific Languages and drafted by Rep. Brian Taniguchi's office, this Act 169 has been incorporated as an amendment to our University of Hawaii Procedures Business Circular 835. This circular essentially states that all information on letterheads, envelopes and business cards will include the appropriate Hawaiian diacritical marks. Other documents can be converted if desired. The office of University and Community Relations can advise you if you have questions regarding this business circular.

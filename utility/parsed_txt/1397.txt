Question: Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 Migration
Article Text: If you plan to upgrade, please let us know which site(s) as we provide a new database and login/password. Before migrating, please note the following: 1. If you are using your own theme, it will not be compatible in Drupal 7. It will need to be updated. 2. If you installed your own modules, please verify that Drupal 7 version of the modules exists. 3. Drupal 7 is on a different server than Drupal 6. 4. A temporary url (if needed) will be provided for your Drupal 7 site. To migrate: 1. Put your Drupal 6 site in maintenance mode. 2. Switch your theme to garland. 3. Disable all non-core modules. 4. Export your database (using phpmyadmin). 5. Import your database into the new database we provide (using phpmyadmin). 6. For your Drupal 6 site (switch your theme back, re-enable your modules, and take your site out of maintenance mode). 7. Copy your files directory to your new Drupal 7 files directory. 8. Update your settings.php file to point to your new database. 9. Run your new Drupal 7 site's update.php. This will update the database and settings.php (verify that db_url points to your new drupal 7 database) to Drupal 7 formatting. 10. Enable your Drupal 7 modules. 11. Enable your theme. 12. Test your site. 13. Once testing is complete, coordinate a date/time with ITS Web Group to change your temporary url to your correct url (if needed). 14. Test your site. 15. Once your Drupal 7 has been running correctly for a few weeks, we'll remove your old Drupal 6 database and files.

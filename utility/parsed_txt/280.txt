Question: Could you please point me to some basic steps on how to operate the point and click version of SAS? If not, which book should I buy?
Article Text: Here's two resources.1. Start up SAS 8.2. Click at the top of the windows on "Solutions" then "Analysis" then "Analyst". The Analyst Application will open. Now click on "Help" and then "Using this Window". The Analyst Application reference book is located on the OnlineDoc CD. If you do not have a copy of the CD, you can register to use it n the SAS web site free of charge. The url to register is http://support.sas.com/faq/016/FAQ01652.html.

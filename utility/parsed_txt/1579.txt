Question: Laulima: Getting Your UH Google Sites To Work With Laulima's Web Content Tool
Article Text: Recent changes with Google Sites have made it so that Google Sites may not work with the Web Content tool in Laulima (note: you can use Google Sites without modification in Laulima's Resources Add Web Links (URLs) option). It appears that by default, Google Sites have a new security option that does not like being embedded in another site's iframe. If you try using a Google Site in your Laulima site with the Web Content tool and you see a blank page (or in some browsers you may get an error), you can try the following: In Google Sites, on the site you want, click the gear icon (Open More Actions menu) in the upper right and choose "Manage site" Scroll to the bottom of the page Under the Security heading, check the box next to "Allow embedding of your sites in other sites" Click "Save" at the top Check the tool in your Laulima site again Note that if you have your page/site set with restrictions such as having to log in to Google@UH to see the content; the users should log in to Google@UH first, otherwise they might just see a blank area where the content should be.

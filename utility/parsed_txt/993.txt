Question: Wireless Priority Service (WPS)
Article Text: During an emergency, personnel responsible for public safety and emergency preparedness may find it difficult to coordinate and respond to events using the cellular telephone network because of congestion. The Department of Homeland Security provides a wireless priority service (WPS) to provide emergency priority access through the cellular telephone network for authorized personnel. WPS is an add-on feature subscribed on a per-cell phone basis that works with existing cellular phones in the WPS enabled cellular network. Check the WPS website to view WPS availability through your cellular service provider. Because you may not have WPS coverage during an emergency, each WPS user applying through the University of Hawaii must also apply for a government emergency telecommunications service (GETS) calling card. To sign-up for the WPS and GETS service through the University of Hawaii, complete the GETS/WPS Request Form and submit it to the Information Technology Services - Telecom Office. ITS is the University's point of contact and will submit your request to the Department of Homeland Security. Once approved, the cellular service provider will bill the cellular phone account directly with a one time WPS activation cost, a monthly WPS service cost, and a usage charge when the WPS service is invoked. Upon leaving your position and/or when you are no longer responsible for coordinating and responding to public safety and emergency preparedness events, the WPS and GETS services must be cancelled. For more information, call the ITS - Telecom Office at (808) 956-6033. Related links: Government Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS)

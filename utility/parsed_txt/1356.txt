Question: How can a UH department license iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch apps for UH-owned devices?
Article Text: UH departments can use a Departmental UH Username and the associated email address to download and purchase apps for departmental iOS devices (iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch) through the App Store. Ownership for apps downloaded through the App Store is tied to the specific Apple ID used to download and purchase the app, so a departmental UH email account can be setup as an Apple ID and used to download and purchase apps with departmental funds using a P-Card. iOS devices have the ability to support multiple Apple IDs so, in theory, a department can download and purchase apps for a UH-owned device with department funds while the primary user could use their own Apple ID to download and purchase apps with personal funds which they would own but could use on the device. To sign in with an Apple ID or switch between Apple IDs on your iOS device: Touch Settings Touch Store Touch the Apple ID that is already signed in. (If no account is signed in, skip to #5.) Touch Sign Out Touch Sign In Touch Use Exisiting Apple ID, if the Apple ID was already created. If the Apple ID was not yet created with the UH departmental email address, touch Create New Apple ID and follow the instructions to setup a new Apple ID with your UH departmental email address. The next screen should prompt you for your username and password for your Apple ID. Enter that information and touch OK. You should now be logged into the Store. Please note that Automatic Downloads should be turned OFF. You can find these settings above your Apple ID in the Store settings menu. Turning any of those settings on will lock the iOS device to the current ID for 90 days.

Question: How to take the UH Information Security Awareness Training (ISAT)
Article Text: Most UH employees, including student and graduate assistants, are required to take the UH Information Security Awareness Training (ISAT). A small group of employees may be exempt. To take the ISAT training: Go to https://www.hawaii.edu/its/acer/ Click Login. Sign in using your UH username and password. On the Acknowledgements and Certifications (ACER) table, click on the UH Information Security Awareness Training Certification link. Click on UH Login. You may see a message that says “Currently, you are not a member of the site called ISAT V2. Would you like to join and become a member of the site?” If you do, click on YES, ADD ME. You will only need to do this once. You will not be asked this question on subsequent returns to the training. You should now be in the ISAT training site and can begin the training by reading the Overview and following the instructions. To return to the training after exiting: Go to Laulima at https://laulima.hawaii.edu In the upper right, click on UH Login and login with your UH Username and password. Go to the View All Sites icon in the upper right (looks like a square of 9 squares), then click on ISAT V2

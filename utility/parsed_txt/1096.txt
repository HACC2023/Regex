Question: How do I add or remove many subscribers to a LISTSERV list at one time?
Article Text: You will need a plain text formatted file with one email address (optionally followed by a first and last name separated by a space) per line. Each line or entry must be separated by a carriage return. You can use programs such as "Notepad" or "Microsoft Word" but you must save the file in plain text (*.txt) format. From the home page, click on "Log In" in the top-right corner and sign in using your email address and LISTSERV password. Under the "List Management" options in the menu on the left, select "Subscriber Reports". You may need to click on the '>' button in the top-left corner to unhide the menu. Click on the "Bulk Operations" link next to the "Add Subscriber" section of the page. In the window that appears, select your desired option and click on "Choose File" to select the plain text file containing the email addresses you would like added or removed. Then, click "Import".

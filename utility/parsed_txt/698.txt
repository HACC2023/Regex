Question: Counter for UH Department Pages (Count.cgi)
Article Text: Note: Only University of Hawaii departments with directories on the ITS server (accessible via http://www.hawaii.edu/departmentname) will be able to use this counter. Personal home pages (http://www2.hawaii.edu) and those on other servers will not be able to use this CGI. Information on using the counter: To call the counter, simply add an inline image tag to your page, e.g., <img src="/cgi-bin/Count.cgi?df=yourdirectory.yourfilename.dat" alt="hit count"> To avoid confusion with other department's pages, the "df," or data file, attribute should be based on the page's URL. For example, if your page's URL is http://www.hawaii.edu/counter/index.html, then the tag may look like this: <img src="/cgi-bin/Count.cgi?df=counter.index.html.dat" alt="hit count"> and will produce this: Be sure to add ".dat" to the end of the data file name. Another example: If your URL is http://www.hawaii.edu/infotech/documents/doc1.html, then you might use: <img src="/cgi-bin/Count.cgi?df=infotech.documents.doc1.html.dat" alt="hit count"> Do not use slashes ("/") in the data file name.

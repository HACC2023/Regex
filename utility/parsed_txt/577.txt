Question: How do I get an increase in my UHUNIX disk quota?
Article Text: Faculty and staff may request a quota increase by logging in with their UH Username and password at the Managing Your UH Username site, then clicking on the "Check Quota/Request More Space" link under the "Mail, Antispam, & Quota Options" section and complete the requested information. Students will need a faculty or staff sponsor to receive an increase in disk space. Students are eligible for a temporary increase of their disk quota for class projects. Students should have their instructor email req-quota-l@lists.hawaii.edu with the class name, the amount of space required, and the student's email account. A quota increase will be granted until the end of the semester at which time the student must clear out their account below 20MB so the quota can be reset back to 20MB.

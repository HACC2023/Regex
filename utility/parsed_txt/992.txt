Question: Government Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS)
Article Text: During an emergency, personnel responsible for public safety and emergency preparedness may find it difficult to coordinate and respond to events using the public telephone network because of congestion. The Department of Homeland Security offers a government emergency telecommunications service (GETS) to provide emergency priority access through the local and long-distance public switched telephone network for authorized emergency personnel. This service can be used from any standard phone and is implemented using a unique dialing plan along with a personal identification number. GETS calls are billed when a call is placed, and there is no initial sign-up or monthly recurring service charges. To apply for a GETS calling card through the University of Hawaii, complete the GETS/WPS Request form and submit it to the Information Technology Services (ITS) - Telecom Office. ITS is the University's point of contact and will submit your request to the Department of Homeland Security. Once approved, ITS will issue you a GETS card with your personal identification number (PIN), and will bill any GETS calls using this PIN to the designated account. Upon leaving the position and or when you are no longer responsible for coordinating and responding to public safety and/or emergency preparedness events, the service must be cancelled. For more information call Harry Morita at the ITS - Telecom Office, 956-6033. Related links Wireless Priority Service (WPS)

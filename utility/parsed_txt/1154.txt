Question: How do I view someone else's Google@UH Calendar?
Article Text: If you wish to view someone’s calendar, in the “Other calendars” section to the left, enter the email address of the person whose calendar you want to view, and press return or enter. If you do not currently have access, the “Add a friend’s calendar” window will appear. Make sure their email address is entered in the “Contact Email” box. In the “Request Access” box, type a short message requesting access to their calendar. Click on "Send Request". An email will then be sent to the person, and if they accept your request, their calendar will automatically be added to your “Other calendars” section. If someone sends you a request for access to your calendar, you will receive an email message with a link. Click on the link. This will open the "Share this calendar" options for your calendar. The person’s email address will already be entered into the “Person” box. Choose a Permission Settings level, click "Add Person", then click "Save" to finish granting them access. If someone grants you permission to their calendar, you will get an email notification, and their calendar will automatically be added under your “Other calendars” section. If they have given you "Make changes AND mange sharing" privileges, their calendar will appear under your "My calendars" section.

Question: TEN-DIGIT DIALING at UH
Article Text: Effective October 24, 2021 The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has adopted 988 as a new three-digit number to be used nationwide to reach the National Suicide Prevention and Mental Health Crisis Lifeline starting July 16, 2022. This will work similarly to dialing 911 to reach Emergency Services nation wide. In order for 988 to work, 10-digit local dialing will be mandatory. Starting October 24, 2021, all local calls, including those on the same island, will require that you dial area code 808 + telephone number. Who is affected: Anyone with an area code 808 telephone number will need to make a change from 7-digit local dialing to 10-digit local dialing. How does this affect UH: On campus dialing (for example 5-digit extension dialing at Manoa, 4-digit extension dialing at Hawaii CC, KCC, UH Hilo, West Oahu and 3 digits at HCC, Kauai CC, LCC, Maui College, WCC ) will remain unchanged. 9+7-digit dialing will still work from all UH campuses within the 808 prefix EXCEPT for calls to 808-988-xxxx (Manoa) which will require 9+10-digits. For consistency and to eliminate erroneous calls to the Lifeline, it is recommended that users adopt 9+10-digit dialing for all US numbers including to 9+808+telephone number from your campus phone. Check with your alarm company to make necessary adjustments to any programmed 808 prefix number to dial to 9+808+telephone number.

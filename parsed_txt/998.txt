Question: Laulima: uploading final grades
Article Text: Laulima offers a gradebook tool for UH faculty to manage and present student scores. In addition, faculty may upload their student's final grade scores directly to Banner. The gradebook is not installed in your Laulima course by default, but it's easy to make it available for your course. A tutorial on publishing grades from gradebook to Banner is available.

Question: ITS Colocation: Drop shipment to ITC Instructions
Article Text: Following are instructions for Information Technology Services(ITS) colocation customers who wish to deliver equipment directly from the hardware vendor to the Information Technology Center: Please address shipment to: #Customer First name/Last Name#/ITSColo University of Hawaii at Manoa IT Center, Rm. 201 2520 Correa Road Honolulu, HI 96822 If the shipment will arrive on a pallet, please specify liftgate service with the shipper. We do not have a forklift. If possible, please have the trucking company call Operations at 956-2393 when the driver is on the way to make the delivery so that we can open the loading dock door. We will contact you when the package arrives, but we can not store the delivery for very long. Please unpack and install the delivery within three days. Following the installation, please remove the packing materials and empty boxes within three days after installation. Packing material left after three days will be disposed of and the department will be charged a $50 clean-up fee. Typically, we are able to receive shipments for you as long as we have a heads up that something is coming. Normally for large installations, we will bring equipment up to the second floor hallway and store it there, and then schedule a date for installation. For the installation, we just need a list of names so that we can create ITC data center access badges so that everyone can access the elevator and a data center door. If you need anything for co-location, feel free to contact us at itscolo@hawaii.edu or 956-2393.

Question: Using Contacts (Address Book) in Google@UH Gmail
Article Text: Gmail has a simple Contacts feature. It allows you to create short nicknames for long email addresses and store them in a contact list. This is convenient when you don't care to type in long addresses such as fred_jones@unix21.philadelphia.pennsylvania.edu. The Web mail address book also allows you to create Group lists. To use contacts, click Contacts in the left column. To create an entry in Contacts: Click Contacts in the left column of the page. Select the New Contact button in the upper left of the Contacts screen. Enter in all appropriate information for the new contact, then select Save. To create a group contact entry: Click Contacts in the left column of the page. Select the New Group button in the upper left of the Contacts screen, this should prompt you to enter a name for the group. After entering a name for the group, click on OK to create the group. The group will now be listed under My Contacts. To add contacts to a contact group: Select any existing contacts you would like to add to the group from the Contacts list, then click on the Groups drop-down menu. You can Add to any existing group, or you can Add to a group that has not yet been created by selecting New group. To use contacts: Click Compose Mail then click To, this should bring up a list of contacts. Most Contacted contacts should be displayed by default. You can search for contacts by name, using Search my contacts, or by selecting the drop down menu to display other options such as My Contacts, or group contacts. Any selected Contacts should be listed in the To field after selecting Done from the Choose from contacts window.

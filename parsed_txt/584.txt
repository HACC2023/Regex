Question: Budgeting for Departmental Computers
Article Text: Departments should expect to spend between $800-$1200 per CPU. Plan on upgrading CPU's every three to four years. Departments should annually budget enough to upgrade a third or fourth of existing computers. By upgrading a fraction of departmental computers every year, departments can avoid large outlays needed to upgrade the entire staff all at once. Additional Costs Monitors will add $150-$1000 more per CPU, but often times you can save money by keeping your existing monitor rather than upgrading to a new one. Expect to spend $100-$150 for a good inkjet printer for personal use. Laser printers will cost $400-$2500. Departments can save costs by buying laser printers with built-in network cards and sharing the printer among several staff members. Software such as Microsoft Office will add an additional $50-$100 through ITS Site Licensing. Training classes for the latest software will run $100-$200 per class. Classes are available from Outreach College or check the ITS Training schedule for available free classes. ref: http://www.hawaii.edu/its/micro/pc/budgeting.html

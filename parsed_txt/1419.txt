Question: Securing Your Smartphones
Article Text: Cell phones are much more than mobile telephones these days. They hold a tremendous amount of personal information (contact lists, calendars, emails, documents, etc.) that need to be protected in case your phone is lost or stolen. Here are some things you can do to protect your information on your smartphones. Keep your software up-to-date: Almost every release of a new version of your software contains a fix for a security vulnerability. Update your software at least every few weeks. Enable Password Protection: Most cell phones have the option to set a password to ensure that only you can access your phone and any information stored on it. If you are unsure of how to enable a password on your phone, check your manual or call support. Ensure you select a difficult to guess password (strong password). Enable Remote Wipe: "Remote wipe" will delete everything on your phone via remote access to prevent your information from falling into the wrong hands. This is done differently on each phone so consult your phone's manual or carrier's support center for assistance with your particular smartphone. Don't "jailbreak" your phone: Jailbreaking a phone bypasses the security of the phone. While it may allow you to install more apps, it also is easier for malware to be installed on your phone. Ensure 3rd party apps are safe: Don't download apps or files from unknown people or sources. Protect your phone from viruses and other malware: Install security software on your phone. More antivirus vendors are developing antivirus for smartphones and other mobile devices.

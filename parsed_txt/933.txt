Question: Basic Online Services for Retirees and Emeriti
Article Text: Retirees and emeriti are supported with most of the same suite of online services as are Faculty. See http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/531 for a list of these services. Annual Emailed Notifications for Renewal Retirees and emeriti are required to renew annually. The renewal confirms intent to continue using UH online services. This is for security reasons since, for retirees and emeriti, there is no other effective mechanism available to determine when a UH Username should be deactivated. Multiple reminders will be emailed. Each reminder will provide a link that may be clicked on (assuming Internet connectivity) to provide a simple renewal process. Should all email reminders be ignored, the UH Username will be deactivated and all files will no longer be available.

        "article_text": "UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\nSTUDENT PRIVACY POLICY OFFICE\nSPPO-21-04\nA Parent Guide to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)\nOther than statutory and regulatory requirements included in the document, the contents of this guidance do not have the force\nand effect of law and are not meant to bind the public. This document is intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding\nexisting requirements under the law or agency policies.\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act or FERPA (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g; 34 CFR Part\n99) provides certain rights for parents regarding their children\u2019s education records. FERPA\ngives these rights to custodial and noncustodial parents alike, unless there is a court order,\nlegally binding document, or State law that specifically provides to the contrary. When a\nstudent reaches 18 years of age or attends an institution of postsecondary education at any age,\nhe or she becomes an \u201celigible student,\u201d and all rights under FERPA transfer from the parent to\nthe student. Given the target audience for this document is parents, this guide is intended to\ndiscuss parents\u2019 rights under FERPA. Under FERPA, the term \u201cparent\u201d means a parent of a\nstudent and includes a natural parent, a guardian, or an individual acting as a parent in the\nabsence of a parent or a guardian. A companion document discussing eligible students\u2019 rights\nunder FERPA is available on our website at https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/resources/ferpa-\ngeneral-guidance-students.\nFERPA is a Federal law that is administered by the Student Privacy Policy Office (SPPO) in\nthe U.S. Department of Education (Department). FERPA protects \u201ceducation records,\u201d which\nare generally defined as records that are directly related to a student and maintained by an\neducational agency or institution or by a party acting for the agency or institution. An\n\u201ceducational agency or institution,\u201d herein after referred to as a \u201cschool,\u201d generally means a\nschool district, a public elementary or secondary school, or an institution of postsecondary\neducation such as a college or university. There are also a few exceptions to the definition of\neducation records, such as law enforcement unit records and sole possession records. More\ninformation is available at https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/faq/what-records-are-exempted-ferpa.\nFERPA applies to schools that receive funding under any program administered by the\nDepartment. Private and faith-based schools at the elementary and secondary levels generally\ndo not receive such funding and are, therefore, generally not subject to FERPA. In addition, the\nconfidentiality of personally identifiable information (PII) in the education records of children\nwith disabilities is further protected by Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education\nAct (IDEA) (20 U.S.C. 1417(c) and 34 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 300.610-300.626). These regulations contain\nconfidentiality provisions that are similar to, but broader than, FERPA. The IDEA-FERPA\ncrosswalk contains additional information comparing IDEA and FERPA and is available at\nhttps://studentprivacy.ed.gov/resources/ferpaidea-cross-walk.\nIssued July 9, 2021\nThe rights provided by FERPA to a parent include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 Access to Education Records\nUnder FERPA, a school or State educational agency (SEA) must provide a parent with an\nopportunity to inspect and review their child\u2019s education records within a reasonable period\nof time, but not more than 45 calendar days following receipt of a request. A school or SEA\nis generally not required to provide copies of the education records unless circumstances\neffectively prevent the parent from exercising the right to inspect and review the education\nrecords. For example, if a parent who does not live within commuting distance of their\nchild\u2019s school requests that the school provide access to his or her child\u2019s education\nrecords, the school would be required to make other arrangements for the parent to inspect\nand review the requested records, or to provide a copy of the requested records.\n\u2022 Amendment of Education Records\nUnder FERPA, a parent has the right to seek amendment or correction of their child\u2019s\neducation records that the parent believes to be inaccurate, misleading, or in violation of the\nchild\u2019s rights of privacy. However, while a school is not required to amend an education\nrecord in accordance with a parent\u2019s request, a school is required to consider the request for\namendment, to inform the parent of its decision, and, if the request is denied, to advise the\nparent of his or her right to a hearing on the matter. If, as a result of the hearing, a school\ndecides not to amend the education records, then the parent has the right to insert a\nstatement in the record commenting on the contested information or stating why the parent\ndisagrees with the decision, or both. That statement must remain with the contested part of\nthe education record for as long as the record is maintained and be included whenever the\ncontested part is disclosed.\nWhile a parent has the right to seek to amend non-substantive factual errors in the student\u2019s\neducation records, the right is not unlimited, and a school is not required by FERPA to\nafford a parent the right to seek to change substantive decisions made by school officials,\nsuch as substantive decisions made in the context of grades given to a student based on\ntheir performance, other evaluations of the student\u2019s performance, or disciplinary decisions.\nThese substantive decisions also include evaluations of whether a student has a disability\nand is eligible for special education and related services, disagreements about the content of\na student\u2019s Individualized Education Program (IEP), or the student\u2019s educational placement\nunder Part B of IDEA. While under FERPA a parent may seek amendment to correct a\nnon-substantive factual error in an IEP, a parent should utilize the Part B of IDEA dispute\nresolution procedures (State complaints, mediation, or due process hearing procedures) to\nresolve disputes with a school regarding substantive matters. Each State has resources to\nhelp parents to participate effectively in their children\u2019s education and development. State\ncontact information is available at https://sites.ed.gov/idea/contacts/#state.\n\u2022 Disclosure of Education Records\nUnder FERPA, a school generally may not disclose PII from a student\u2019s education records\nto a third party unless the student\u2019s parent has provided prior written consent. However,\n2\nthere are a number of exceptions to FERPA\u2019s general consent requirement, some of which\nare described below. Under these exceptions, schools are permitted to disclose PII from\neducation records without consent, but they are not required to do so by FERPA.\nSchool Official\nFERPA allows \u201cschool officials,\u201d including teachers, within the school to obtain access to\nPII from education records without consent, provided that the school has determined the\nofficials have a \u201clegitimate educational interest\u201d in the information. The school\u2019s annual\nnotification of rights under FERPA must specify the criteria for determining who\nconstitutes a \u201cschool official\u201d and what the school considers to be a \u201clegitimate educational\ninterest.\u201d Typically, a school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official\nneeds to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility.\nAlso, under the \u201cschool officials\u201d exception to the consent requirement, FERPA permits a\nschool to disclose education records to contractors (e.g., software/application vendors,\nlawyers), consultants (e.g., nutritional or information technology consultants), volunteers\n(e.g., home room parent volunteers, field trip chaperones, student volunteers), or other third\nparties to whom the school has outsourced institutional services or functions, provided that\nthe outside party:\n1. Performs an institutional service or function for which the school would otherwise use\nemployees;\n2. Is under the direct control of the school with respect to the use and maintenance of\neducation records;\n3. Is subject to the requirements in FERPA that PII from education records may be used\nonly for the purposes for which the disclosure was made, and which govern the\nredisclosure of PII from education records; and\n4. Meets the criteria specified in the school\u2019s annual notification of FERPA rights for being\na school official with a legitimate educational interest in the education records.\nMore information regarding the use of school volunteers and FERPA is available at\nhttps://studentprivacy.ed.gov/training/school-volunteers-and-ferpa.\nSeeks or Intends to Enroll\nAnother exception to FERPA\u2019s general consent requirement permits a school to disclose\nPII from a student\u2019s education records, without consent, to another school in which the\nstudent seeks or intends to enroll, or where the student is already enrolled, as long as the\npurpose of the disclosure is related to the student\u2019s enrollment or transfer. A school that\ndiscloses education records under this exception must make a reasonable attempt to notify\nthe parent of the disclosure, unless the disclosure is initiated by the parent, or the school\u2019s\nannual notification of rights under FERPA includes a notice that it forwards education\nrecords to other schools that have requested the records and in which the student seeks or\nintends to enroll or is already enrolled, as long as the disclosure is for purposes related to\nthe student\u2019s enrollment or transfer. A school that discloses education records under this\nexception also must provide the parent, upon request, a copy of the records that were\n3\ndisclosed or, upon request, an opportunity for a hearing to amend the records that were\ndisclosed. Under this exception, a school has the discretion to disclose academic,\ndisciplinary, or any other PII from the student\u2019s education records to the new school.\nFurther, a parent does not, under FERPA, have the right to prevent a school from disclosing\nsuch PII from the student\u2019s education records, or from communicating information about a\nstudent more generally, to the school in which the student seeks or intends to enroll.\nDirectory Information\nFERPA also permits a school to disclose PII from a student\u2019s education records, without\nconsent, when such information has been appropriately designated as \u201cdirectory\ninformation\u201d and the parent has not opted out of the disclosure of such designated\ninformation. The FERPA regulations define directory information as information in a\nstudent\u2019s education record that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion\nof privacy if disclosed. Directory information may include information such as the\nstudent\u2019s name, address, telephone number, email address, photograph, date and place of\nbirth, major field of study, grade level, enrollment status (e.g., undergraduate or graduate,\nfull-time or part-time), dates of attendance (i.e., the period of time during which the\nstudent attends or attended the school), participation in officially recognized activities\nand sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, degrees, honors and awards\nreceived, and the most recent school attended. FERPA provides that a school may\ndisclose, without consent, directory information if the school has given public notice to\nparents of the types of PII that it has designated as directory information and the process,\nincluding period of time, for parents to opt out of certain directory information\ndisclosures. This notice is often included in the annual notification discussed below. For\nmore information regarding directory information, visit\nhttps://studentprivacy.ed.gov/training/b-cs-student-directory-information.\nDependent Student\nFERPA provides ways in which a school may share education records on an eligible\nstudent with their parents. Schools may, but are not required to, disclose any and all\neducation records to parents, without the consent of the eligible student, if the student is a\n\u201cdependent student,\u201d as that term is defined in Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nGenerally, if either parent has claimed the student as a dependent on the parent\u2019s most\nrecent income tax return, a school may disclose the student\u2019s education records to either\nparent, without the eligible student\u2019s consent.\nThis exception to FERPA\u2019s general consent rule also permits institutions of\npostsecondary education to share information with parents of students who are enrolled in\nboth a high school and a college or university (dually enrolled). In this situation, the\nparents retain the rights over the student\u2019s education records maintained by the high\nschool, if the student is under the age of 18 years, and the student retains the rights over\nthe education records maintained by the college or university.\n4\nOther Exceptions\nProvided certain conditions are met that are not included in the summary below, other\nexceptions to FERPA\u2019s general consent requirement that would permit the disclosure of\nPII from education records include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 To authorized representatives of, among others, State and local educational authorities,\nsuch as a State department of education, in connection with an audit or evaluation of\nFederal- or State-supported education programs, or for the enforcement of or\ncompliance with Federal legal requirements that relate to those programs\n\u2022 To a representative of a State or local child welfare agency or Tribal organization\nregarding a child in foster care\n\u2022 To State and local officials or authorities pursuant to a State statute concerning the\njuvenile justice system and the system\u2019s ability to effectively serve the student whose\nrecords are being disclosed\n\u2022 To organizations conducting studies for, or on behalf of, the school for specified\npurposes including improving instruction\n\u2022 To comply with a judicial order or a lawfully issued subpoena\n\u2022 In connection with a health or safety emergency\nAnnual Notification of FERPA Rights\nUnder FERPA, a school must annually notify parents of their rights under FERPA. There are\nseparate annual notifications and other rights under IDEA. The FERPA annual notification\nmust include information regarding a parent\u2019s right to inspect and review his or her child\u2019s\neducation records, the right to seek to amend the records, the right to consent to disclosure of\nPII from the records (except in certain circumstances), and the right to file a complaint with\nSPPO regarding an alleged failure by a school to comply with FERPA. The notification must\nalso inform parents of the school\u2019s criteria for the terms \u201cschool official\u201d and \u201clegitimate\neducational interest\u201d in certain instances. A school is not required to notify parents\nindividually, but rather is required to provide the notice by any means that are reasonably likely\nto inform parents of their rights. These means could include publication in a school activities\ncalendar, newsletter, student handbook, or on a school\u2019s website.\nComplaints of Alleged Violations with FERPA\nParents who believe that their FERPA rights may have been violated may file a complaint with\nSPPO at https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/file-a-complaint. SPPO will review the complaint to\nensure the complaint:\n\u2022 Is filed, in writing, by a parent who maintains FERPA rights over the education records\nthat are the subject of the complaint;\n\u2022 Is submitted to SPPO within 180 days of the date of the alleged violation or of the date\nthat the parent knew or reasonably should have known of the alleged violation; and\n\u2022 Contains specific allegations of fact giving reasonable cause to believe that a violation\nof FERPA has occurred.\n5\nSPPO will then make a case-by-case determination to determine the best mechanism for\nresolving the underlying situation. Sometimes the action will be a formal investigation; for\nother complaints, consistent with the statute and applicable regulations, we will take other\nappropriate actions, such as acting as an intermediary or providing resolution assistance. More\ninformation regarding our complaint process is available at https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/file-a-\ncomplaint.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information regarding FERPA and other student privacy issues, please visit our\nwebsite at https://studentprivacy.ed.gov.\nIf you have questions about FERPA that are not addressed here, you may also submit a\nquestion through our website at https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/contact or write to SPPO for\nadditional guidance at the following address:\nStudent Privacy Policy Office\nU.S. Department of Education\n400 Maryland Avenue, SW\nWashington, DC 20202-8520\n6\n"

FERPA protects \u201ceducation records,\u201d\nwhich are generally defined as records that are directly related to a student and maintained\nby an educational agency or institution or by a party acting for the agency or institution. An\n\u201ceducational agency or institution,\u201d hereinafter referred to as a \u201cschool,\u201d generally means a\nschool district, a public elementary or secondary school, or an institution of postsecondary\neducation, such as a college or university.

Private and faith-based schools at the elementary and secondary levels\ngenerally do not receive such funding and are, therefore, generally not subject to FERPA.\nPrivate institutions of postsecondary education, however, generally do receive such funding\n(e.g., student aid under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended) and are,\ntherefore, generally subject to FERPA. In addition, the confidentiality of personally\nidentifiable information (PII) in the education records of students with disabilities is further\nprotected by Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) (20 U.S.C.\n1417(c) and 34 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 300.610-300.626). The IDEA and its implementing regulations\ncontain confidentiality provisions that are similar to, but broader than, FERPA, and cover\nstudents with disabilities who have turned 18 but are still eligible under IDEA. Depending\non State law, the rights accorded to parents under IDEA Part B may not automatically\ntransfer to the student when the student with a disability reaches 18 years old or attends an\ninstitution of postsecondary education at any age. The IDEA-FERPA crosswalk contains\nadditional information comparing IDEA and FERPA and is available at\nhttps://studentprivacy.ed.gov/resources/ferpaidea-crosswalk.\nIssued March 8, 2023\nThe rights provided by FERPA to an eligible student include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 Access to Education Records\nUnder FERPA, a school or State educational agency (SEA) must provide an eligible student\nwith an opportunity to inspect and review their education records within a reasonable period\nof time, but not more than 45 calendar days following the receipt of a request. A school or\nSEA is generally not required to provide an eligible student with copies of education records\nunless circumstances effectively prevent an eligible student from exercising their right to\ninspect and review the education records. For example, if an eligible student who does not\nlive within commuting distance of the school requests access to their education records, the\nschool would be required to make other arrangements for the eligible student to inspect and\nreview the requested records, or to provide a copy of the requested records.\nFERPA\u2019s access provisions apply to education records maintained by educational agencies\nor institutions, including documents such as academic transcripts. While eligible students\nhave a right to inspect and review their education records, including academic transcripts\nmaintained by their schools, eligible students do not necessarily have a right to obtain a\ncopy of such records under FERPA.\n\u2022 Amendment of Education Records\nUnder FERPA, an eligible student has the right to seek amendment or correction of their\neducation records that the eligible student believes to be inaccurate, misleading, or in\nviolation of their rights of privacy. However, while a school is not required to amend an\neducation record in accordance with an eligible student\u2019s request, a school is required to\nconsider the request for amendment, to inform the student of its decision, and, if the request\nis denied, to advise the student of their right to a hearing on the matter. If, as a result of the\nhearing, a school decides not to amend the education records, then the eligible student has\nthe right to insert a statement in the record commenting on the contested information or\nstating why they disagree with the decision, or both. That statement must remain with the\ncontested part of the education record for as long as the record is maintained and be\nincluded whenever the contested part is disclosed.\nWhile an eligible student has the right to seek to amend non-substantive factual errors in the\nstudent\u2019s education records, the right is not unlimited. A school is not required by FERPA to\nafford an eligible student the right to seek to change substantive decisions made by school\nofficials, such as substantive decisions made in the context of grades given to a student\nbased on their performance, other evaluations of the student\u2019s performance, or disciplinary\ndecisions.\n\u2022 Disclosure of Education Records\nUnder FERPA, a school generally may not disclose PII from an eligible student\u2019s education\nrecords to a third party unless the eligible student has provided prior written consent. Even\nwith the prior written consent of an eligible student, a school is not required by FERPA to\ndisclose PII from education records to third parties. Accordingly, under FERPA, a school\n2\nmay have a policy of not disclosing PII from education records to third parties if the eligible\nstudent owes money to the school. There are several exceptions to FERPA\u2019s general consent\nrequirement, some of which are described below. Under these exceptions, schools are\npermitted to disclose PII from education records without consent to a third party, but they\nare not required to do so by FERPA.\nSchool Official\nFERPA allows \u201cschool officials,\u201d including faculty and staff within an institution of\npostsecondary education, to access PII from education records without consent, provided\nthe school has determined that they have a \u201clegitimate educational interest\u201d in the\ninformation. The school\u2019s annual notification of rights under FERPA must specify the\ncriteria for determining which parties are \u201cschool officials\u201d and what the school considers\nto be a \u201clegitimate educational interest.\u201d Typically, a school official has a legitimate\neducational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill\ntheir professional responsibility.\nAlso, under the \u201cschool official\u201d exception to the consent requirement, FERPA permits a\nschool to disclose PII from education records to contractors (e.g., software/application\nvendors or lawyers), consultants (e.g., nutritional or information technology consultants),\nvolunteers (e.g., student volunteers or tutors) or other third parties to whom the school\nhas outsourced institutional services or functions, provided that the outside party:\n1. Performs an institutional service or function for which the school would otherwise\nuse employees;\n2. Is under the direct control of the school with respect to the use and maintenance of\neducation records;\n3. Is subject to the requirements in FERPA that PII from education records may be used\nonly for the purposes for which the disclosure was made, and which govern the\nredisclosure of PII from education records; and\n4. Meets the criteria specified in the school\u2019s annual notification of FERPA rights for\nbeing a school official with a legitimate educational interest in the education records.\nSeeks or Intends to Enroll\nAnother exception to FERPA\u2019s general consent requirement permits a school to disclose\nPII from an eligible student\u2019s education records, without consent, to another school in\nwhich the student seeks or intends to enroll, or where the student is already enrolled, as\nlong as the purpose of the disclosure is related to the student\u2019s enrollment or transfer. A\nschool that discloses education records under this exception must make a reasonable\nattempt to notify the eligible student of the disclosure, unless the disclosure is initiated by\nthe student, or the school\u2019s annual notification of rights under FERPA includes a notice\nthat it forwards education records to other schools that have requested the records and in\nwhich the student seeks or intends to enroll or is already enrolled, as long as the\ndisclosure is for purposes related to the student\u2019s enrollment or transfer. A school that\ndiscloses education records under this exception also must provide the student, upon\nrequest, a copy of the records that were disclosed and, upon request, an opportunity for a\n3\nhearing to amend the records that were disclosed. Under this exception, a school has the\ndiscretion to disclose academic, disciplinary, or any other PII from the student\u2019s\neducation records to the new school. Further, an eligible student does not, under FERPA,\nhave the right to prevent a school from disclosing such PII from the student\u2019s education\nrecords, or from communicating information about a student more generally, to the\nschool in which the student seeks or intends to enroll.\nDirectory Information\nFERPA also permits a school to disclose PII from an eligible student\u2019s education records,\nwithout consent, when such information has been appropriately designated as \u201cdirectory\ninformation,\u201d and the eligible student has not opted out of the disclosure of such\ndesignated information. The FERPA regulations define \u201cdirectory information\u201d as\ninformation in a student\u2019s education record that would not generally be considered\nharmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed. Directory information may include\ninformation such as the student\u2019s name, address, telephone number, email address,\nphotograph, date and place of birth, major field of study, grade level, enrollment status\n(e.g., undergraduate or graduate, full-time or part-time), dates of attendance (i.e., the\nperiod of time during which the student attends or attended the school), participation in\nofficially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic\nteams, degrees, honors and awards received, and the most recent school attended. FERPA\nprovides that a school may disclose, without consent, directory information if the school\nhas given public notice to eligible students of the types of PII that it has designated as\ndirectory information and the process, including period of time, for eligible students to\nopt out of certain directory information disclosures. This notice is often included in the\nannual notification discussed below. For more information regarding directory\ninformation, visit https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/training/b-cs-student-directory-\ninformation.\nDependent Student\nFERPA provides ways in which a school may share, without the consent of an eligible\nstudent, education records of the eligible student with their parents. Schools may, but are\nnot required to, disclose any and all PII from education records to parents, without the\nconsent of the eligible student, if the student is a \u201cdependent student,\u201d as that term is\ndefined in Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code. Generally, if either parent has\nclaimed the student as a dependent on the parent\u2019s most recent income tax return, a\nschool may disclose the student\u2019s education records to either parent, without the eligible\nstudent\u2019s consent.\nThis exception to FERPA\u2019s general consent rule, where applicable, also permits\ninstitutions of postsecondary education to share, without the prior written consent of an\neligible student, PII from education records of students who are enrolled in both a high\nschool and the college or university (dually enrolled) with the parents of such dually\nenrolled students. In this situation, the parents retain the rights over the student\u2019s\neducation records maintained by the high school, if the student is under the age of 18\n4\nyears, but the student retains the rights over the education records maintained by the\ncollege or university.\nOther Exceptions\nProvided certain conditions are met that are not included in the summary below, other\nexceptions to FERPA\u2019s general consent requirement that permit the disclosure of PII\nfrom education records include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 To authorized representatives of, among others, the U.S. Secretary of Education, as\nwell as State and local educational authorities, for audit or evaluation of Federal- or\nState-supported education programs, or for the enforcement of or compliance with\nFederal legal requirements that relate to those programs;\n\u2022 In connection with financial aid for which the student has applied or received;\n\u2022 To organizations conducting studies for, or on behalf of, the school for the purposes\nof administering predictive tests, administering student aid programs, or improving\ninstruction;\n\u2022 To the victim of an alleged perpetrator of a crime of violence or a non-forcible sex\noffense concerning the final results of a disciplinary hearing conducted by an\ninstitution of postsecondary education against the alleged perpetrator of such crime or\noffense with respect to the alleged crime or offense;\n\u2022 To any third party the final results, as described in FERPA regulations, of a\ndisciplinary proceeding conducted by an institution of postsecondary education\nagainst a student who is the alleged perpetrator of a crime of violence or non-forcible\nsex offense if the student is found by the institution to have violated its rules or\npolicies as a result of the disciplinary proceeding, as long as the disclosure does not\ninclude the name of any other student, including a victim or witness, without the\nwritten consent of that other student;\n\u2022 To comply with a judicial order or a lawfully issued subpoena;\n\u2022 In connection with a health or safety emergency; and\n\u2022 To a parent of a student at an institution of postsecondary education regarding the\nstudent\u2019s violation of any Federal, State, or local law, or of any rule or policy of the\ninstitution, governing the use or possession of alcohol or a controlled substance,\nwhere the institution determines that the student has committed a disciplinary\nviolation with respect to that use or possession, and the student is under 21 years of\nage at the time of the disclosure to the parent.\nAnnual Notification of FERPA Rights\nUnder FERPA, a school must annually notify eligible students of their rights under FERPA.\nThe annual notification must include information regarding an eligible student\u2019s right to\ninspect and review their education records, the right to seek to amend their records, the right\nto consent to disclosure of PII from their records (except in certain circumstances), and the\nright to file a complaint with SPPO regarding an alleged failure by a school to comply with\nFERPA. The notification must also inform eligible students of the school\u2019s criteria for the\nterms \u201cschool official\u201d and \u201clegitimate educational interest\u201d in certain instances. A school is\nnot required to notify eligible students individually, but rather is required to provide the\n5\nnotice by any means that are reasonably likely to inform eligible students of their rights.\nThese means could include publication in a school activities calendar, newsletter, student\nhandbook, or on a school\u2019s website.\nComplaints of Alleged Violations of FERPA\nEligible students who believe that their FERPA rights may have been violated may file a\ncomplaint with SPPO at https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/file-a-complaint. SPPO will review\nthe complaint to ensure that the complaint:\n\u2022 Is filed, in writing, by an eligible student who maintains FERPA rights over the\neducation records that are the subject of the complaint;\n\u2022 Is submitted to SPPO within 180 days of the date of the alleged violation or of the\ndate that the eligible student knew or reasonably should have known of the alleged\nviolation; and\n\u2022 Contains specific allegations of fact giving reasonable cause to believe that a\nviolation of FERPA has occurred.\nSPPO will then make a case-by-case determination of the best mechanism for resolving the\ncomplaint. Sometimes the action will be an investigation, while for other complaints,\nconsistent with the statute and applicable regulations, we will take other appropriate actions,\nsuch as acting as an intermediary or providing resolution assistance.

        "article_text": "THE DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT OF 1998\nU.S. Copyright Office Summary\nDecember 1998\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)1 was signed into law by\nPresident Clinton on October 28, 1998. The legislation implements two 1996 World\nIntellectual Property Organization (WIPO) treaties: the WIPO Copyright Treaty and\nthe WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty. The DMCA also addresses a\nnumber of other significant copyright-related issues.\nThe DMCA is divided into five titles:\n! Title I, the \u201cWIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms\nTreaties Implementation Act of 1998,\u201d implements the WIPO\ntreaties.\n! Title II, the \u201cOnline Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation\nAct,\u201d creates limitations on the liability of online service providers for\ncopyright infringement when engaging in certain types of activities.\n! Title III, the \u201cComputer Maintenance Competition Assurance\nAct,\u201d creates an exemption for making a copy of a computer program\nby activating a computer for purposes of maintenance or repair.\n! Title IV contains six miscellaneous provisions, relating to the\nfunctions of the Copyright Office, distance education, the exceptions\nin the Copyright Act for libraries and for making ephemeral recordings,\n\u201cwebcasting\u201d of sound recordings on the Internet, and the applicability\nof collective bargaining agreement obligations in the case of transfers\nof rights in motion pictures.\n! Title V, the \u201cVessel Hull Design Protection Act,\u201d creates a new form\nof protection for the design of vessel hulls.\nThis memorandum summarizes briefly each title of the DMCA. It provides\nmerely an overview of the law\u2019s provisions; for purposes of length and readability a\nsignificant amount of detail has been omitted. A complete understanding of any\nprovision of the DMCA requires reference to the text of the legislation itself.\n1Pub. L. No. 105-304, 112 Stat. 2860 (Oct. 28, 1998).\nCopyright Office Summary December 1998 Page 1\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998\nTITLE I: WIPO TREATY IMPLEMENTATION\nTitle I implements the WIPO treaties. First, it makes certain technical\namendments to U.S. law, in order to provide appropriate references and links to the\ntreaties. Second, it creates two new prohibitions in Title 17 of the U.S. Code\u2014one on\ncircumvention of technological measures used by copyright owners to protect their\nworks and one on tampering with copyright management information\u2014and adds civil\nremedies and criminal penalties for violating the prohibitions. In addition, Title I\nrequires the U.S. Copyright Office to perform two joint studies with the National\nTelecommunications and Information Administration of the Department of\nCommerce (NTIA).\nTechnical Amendments\nNational Eligibility\nThe WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) and the WIPO Performances and\nPhonograms Treaty (WPPT) each require member countries to provide protection to\ncertain works from other member countries or created by nationals of other member\ncountries. That protection must be no less favorable than that accorded to domestic\nworks.\nSection 104 of the Copyright Act establishes the conditions of eligibility for\nprotection under U.S. law for works from other countries. Section 102(b) of the\nDMCA amends section 104 of the Copyright Act and adds new definitions to section\n101 of the Copyright Act in order to extend the protection of U.S. law to those works\nrequired to be protected under the WCT and the WPPT.\nRestoration of Copyright Protection\nBoth treaties require parties to protect preexisting works from other member\ncountries that have not fallen into the public domain in the country of origin through\nthe expiry of the term of protection. A similar obligation is contained in both the\nBerne Convention and the TRIPS Agreement. In 1995 this obligation was imple-\nmented in the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, creating a new section 104A in the\nCopyright Act to restore protection to works from Berne or WTO member countries\nthat are still protected in the country of origin, but fell into the public domain in the\nUnited States in the past because of a failure to comply with formalities that then\nexisted in U.S. law, or due to a lack of treaty relations. Section 102(c) of the DMCA\namends section 104A to restore copyright protection in the same circumstances to\nworks from WCT and WPPT member countries.\nCopyright Office Summary December 1998 Page 2\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998\nRegistration as a Prerequisite to Suit\nThe remaining technical amendment relates to the prohibition in both treaties\nagainst conditioning the exercise or enjoyment of rights on the fulfillment of\nformalities. Section 411(a) of the Copyright Act requires claims to copyright to be\nregistered with the Copyright Office before a lawsuit can be initiated by the copyright\nowner, but exempts many foreign works in order to comply with existing treaty\nobligations under the Berne Convention. Section 102(d) of the DMCA amends section\n411(a) by broadening the exemption to cover all foreign works.\nTechnological Protection and Copyright Management Systems\nEach of the WIPO treaties contains virtually identical language obligating\nmember states to prevent circumvention of technological measures used to protect\ncopyrighted works, and to prevent tampering with the integrity of copyright\nmanagement information. These obligations serve as technological adjuncts to the\nexclusive rights granted by copyright law. They provide legal protection that the\ninternational copyright community deemed critical to the safe and efficient exploitation\nof works on digital networks.\nCircumvention of Technological Protection Measures\nGeneral approach\nArticle 11 of the WCT states:\nContracting Parties shall provide adequate legal protec-\ntion and effective legal remedies against the circumven-\ntion of effective technological measures that are used\nby authors in connection with the exercise of their\nrights under this Treaty or the Berne Convention and\nthat restrict acts, in respect of their works, which are\nnot authorized by the authors concerned or permitted\nby law.\nArticle 18 of the WPPT contains nearly identical language.\nSection 103 of the DMCA adds a new chapter 12 to Title 17 of the U.S. Code.\nNew section 1201 implements the obligation to provide adequate and effective\nprotection against circumvention of technological measures used by copyright owners\nto protect their works.\nSection 1201 divides technological measures into two categories: measures that\nprevent unauthorized access to a copyrighted work and measures that prevent\nCopyright Office Summary December 1998 Page 3\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998\nunauthorized copying2 of a copyrighted work. Making or selling devices or services that\nare used to circumvent either category of technological measure is prohibited in certain\ncircumstances, described below. As to the act of circumvention in itself, the provision\nprohibits circumventing the first category of technological measures, but not the\nsecond.\nThis distinction was employed to assure that the public will have the continued\nability to make fair use of copyrighted works. Since copying of a work may be a fair use\nunder appropriate circumstances, section 1201 does not prohibit the act of circumvent-\ning a technological measure that prevents copying. By contrast, since the fair use\ndoctrine is not a defense to the act of gaining unauthorized access to a work, the act of\ncircumventing a technological measure in order to gain access is prohibited.\nSection 1201 proscribes devices or services that fall within any one of the\nfollowing three categories:\n! they are primarily designed or produced to circumvent;\n! they have only limited commercially significant purpose or use other\nthan to circumvent; or\n! they are marketed for use in circumventing.\nNo mandate\nSection 1201 contains language clarifying that the prohibition on circumvention\ndevices does not require manufacturers of consumer electronics, telecommunications\nor computing equipment to design their products affirmatively to respond to any\nparticular technological measure. (Section 1201(c)(3)). Despite this general \u2018no\nmandate\u2019 rule, section 1201(k) does mandate an affirmative response for one particular\ntype of technology: within 18 months of enactment, all analog videocassette recorders\nmust be designed to conform to certain defined technologies, commonly known as\nMacrovision, currently in use for preventing unauthorized copying of analog\nvideocassettes and certain analog signals. The provision prohibits rightholders from\napplying these specified technologies to free television and basic and extended basic tier\ncable broadcasts.\n2\u201cCopying\u201d is used in this context as a short-hand for the exercise of any of the exclus-\nive rights of an author under section 106 of the Copyright Act. Consequently, a technological\nmeasure that prevents unauthorized distribution or public performance of a work would fall\nin this second category.\nCopyright Office Summary December 1998 Page 4\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998\nSavings clauses\nSection 1201 contains two general savings clauses. First, section 1201(c)(1)\nstates that nothing in section 1201 affects rights, remedies, limitations or defenses to\ncopyright infringement, including fair use. Second, section 1201(c)(2) states that\nnothing in section 1201 enlarges or diminishes vicarious or contributory copyright\ninfringement.\nExceptions\nFinally, the prohibitions contained in section 1201 are subject to a number of\nexceptions. One is an exception to the operation of the entire section, for law\nenforcement, intelligence and other governmental activities. (Section 1201(e)). The\nothers relate to section 1201(a), the provision dealing with the category of technological\nmeasures that control access to works.\nThe broadest of these exceptions, section 1201(a)(1)(B)-(E), establishes an\nongoing administrative rule-making proceeding to evaluate the impact of the\nprohibition against the act of circumventing such access-control measures. This\nconduct prohibition does not take effect for two years. Once it does, it is subject to\nan exception for users of a work which is in a particular class of works if they are or are\nlikely to be adversely affected by virtue of the prohibition in making noninfringing uses.\nThe applicability of the exemption is determined through a periodic rulemaking by the\nLibrarian of Congress, on the recommendation of the Register of Copyrights, who is\nto consult with the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and\nInformation.\nThe six additional exceptions are as follows:\n1. Nonprofit library, archive and educational institution exception\n(section 1201(d)). The prohibition on the act of circumvention of\naccess control measures is subject to an exception that permits\nnonprofit libraries, archives and educational institutions to circumvent\nsolely for the purpose of making a good faith determination as to\nwhether they wish to obtain authorized access to the work.\n2. Reverse engineering (section 1201(f)). This exception permits\ncircumvention, and the development of technological means for such\ncircumvention, by a person who has lawfully obtained a right to use a\ncopy of a computer program for the sole purpose of identifying and\nanalyzing elements of the program necessary to achieve interoperability\nwith other programs, to the extent that such acts are permitted under\ncopyright law.\n3. Encryption research (section 1201(g)). An exception for encryption\nresearch permits circumvention of access control measures, and the\nCopyright Office Summary December 1998 Page 5\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998\ndevelopment of the technological means to do so, in order to identify\nflaws and vulnerabilities of encryption technologies.\n4. Protection of minors (section 1201(h)). This exception allows a court\napplying the prohibition to a component or part to consider the\nnecessity for its incorporation in technology that prevents access of\nminors to material on the Internet.\n5. Personal privacy (section 1201(i)). This exception permits circumven-\ntion when the technological measure, or the work it protects, is capable\nof collecting or disseminating personally identifying information about\nthe online activities of a natural person.\n6. Security testing (section 1201(j)). This exception permits circumven-\ntion of access control measures, and the development of technological\nmeans for such circumvention, for the purpose of testing the security\nof a computer, computer system or computer network, with the\nauthorization of its owner or operator.\nEach of the exceptions has its own set of conditions on its applicability, which\nare beyond the scope of this summary.\nIntegrity of Copyright Management Information\nArticle 12 of the WCT provides in relevant part:\nContracting Parties shall provide adequate and effective\nlegal remedies against any person knowingly performing\nany of the following acts knowing, or with respect to\ncivil remedies having reasonable grounds to know, that\nit will induce, enable, facilitate or conceal an infringe-\nment of any right covered by this Treaty or the Berne\nConvention:\n(i) to remove or alter any electronic rights\nmanagement information without authority;\n(ii) to distribute, import for distribution, broad-\ncast or communicate to the public, without authority,\nworks or copies of works knowing that electronic rights\nmanagement information has been removed or altered\nwithout authority.\nArticle 19 of the WPPT contains nearly identical language.\nNew section 1202 is the provision implementing this obligation to protect the\nintegrity of copyright management information (CMI). The scope of the protection\nCopyright Office Summary December 1998 Page 6\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998\nis set out in two separate paragraphs, the first dealing with false CMI and the second\nwith removal or alteration of CMI. Subsection (a) prohibits the knowing provision or\ndistribution of false CMI, if done with the intent to induce, enable, facilitate or conceal\ninfringement. Subsection (b) bars the intentional removal or alteration of CMI without\nauthority, as well as the dissemination of CMI or copies of works, knowing that the\nCMI has been removed or altered without authority. Liability under subsection (b)\nrequires that the act be done with knowledge or, with respect to civil remedies, with\nreasonable grounds to know that it will induce, enable, facilitate or conceal an\ninfringement.\nSubsection (c) defines CMI as identifying information about the work, the\nauthor, the copyright owner, and in certain cases, the performer, writer or director of\nthe work, as well as the terms and conditions for use of the work, and such other\ninformation as the Register of Copyrights may prescribe by regulation. Information\nconcerning users of works is explicitly excluded.\nSection 1202 is subject to a general exemption for law enforcement, intelligence\nand other governmental activities. (Section 1202(d)). It also contains limitations on the\nliability of broadcast stations and cable systems for removal or alteration of CMI in\ncertain circumstances where there is no intent to induce, enable, facilitate or conceal\nan infringement. (Section 1202(e)).\nRemedies\nAny person injured by a violation of section 1201 or 1202 may bring a civil\naction in Federal court. Section 1203 gives courts the power to grant a range of\nequitable and monetary remedies similar to those available under the Copyright Act,\nincluding statutory damages. The court has discretion to reduce or remit damages in\ncases of innocent violations, where the violator proves that it was not aware and had\nno reason to believe its acts constituted a violation. (Section 1203(c)(5)(A)). Special\nprotection is given to nonprofit libraries, archives and educational institutions, which\nare entitled to a complete remission of damages in these circumstances. (Section\n1203(c)(5)(B)).\nIn addition, it is a criminal offense to violate section 1201 or 1202 wilfully and\nfor purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain. Under section 1204\npenalties range up to a $500,000 fine or up to five years imprisonment for a first\noffense, and up to a $1,000,000 fine or up to 10 years imprisonment for subsequent\noffenses. Nonprofit libraries, archives and educational institutions are entirely\nexempted from criminal liability. (Section 1204(b)).\nCopyright Office Summary December 1998 Page 7\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998\nCopyright Office and NTIA Studies Relating to Technological Develop-\nment\nTitle I of the DMCA requires the Copyright Office to conduct two studies\njointly with NTIA, one dealing with encryption and the other with the effect of\ntechnological developments on two existing exceptions in the Copyright Act. New\nsection 1201(g)(5) of Title 17 of the U.S. Code requires the Register of Copyrights and\nthe Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information to report\nto the Congress no later than one year from enactment on the effect that the\nexemption for encryption research (new section 1201(g)) has had on encryption\nresearch, the development of encryption technology, the adequacy and effectiveness\nof technological measures designed to protect copyrighted works, and the protection\nof copyright owners against unauthorized access to their encrypted copyrighted works.\nSection 104 of the DMCA requires the Register of Copyrights and the Assistant\nSecretary of Commerce for Communications and Information to jointly evaluate (1)\nthe effects of Title I of the DMCA and the development of electronic commerce and\nassociated technology on the operation of sections 109 (first sale doctrine) and 117\n(exemption allowing owners of copies of computer programs to reproduce and adapt\nthem for use on a computer), and (2) the relationship between existing and emergent\ntechnology and the operation of those sections. This study is due 24 months after the\ndate of enactment of the DMCA.\nTITLE II: ONLINE COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT LIABILITY LIMITATION\nTitle II of the DMCA adds a new section 512 to the Copyright Act3 to create\nfour new limitations on liability for copyright infringement by online service providers.\nThe limitations are based on the following four categories of conduct by a service\nprovider:\n1. Transitory communications;\n2. System caching;\n3. Storage of information on systems or networks at direction of users;\nand\n4. Information location tools.\nNew section 512 also includes special rules concerning the application of these\nlimitations to nonprofit educational institutions.\n3The Fairness in Musical Licensing Act, Title II of Pub. L. No. 105-298, 112 Stat. 2827,\n2830-34 (Oct. 27, 1998) also adds a new section 512 to the Copyright Act. This duplication of\nsection numbers will need to be corrected in a technical amendments bill.\nCopyright Office Summary December 1998 Page 8\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998\nEach limitation entails a complete bar on monetary damages, and restricts the\navailability of injunctive relief in various respects. (Section 512(j)). Each limitation\nrelates to a separate and distinct function, and a determination of whether a service\nprovider qualifies for one of the limitations does not bear upon a determination of\nwhether the provider qualifies for any of the other three. (Section 512(n)).\nThe failure of a service provider to qualify for any of the limitations in section\n512 does not necessarily make it liable for copyright infringement. The copyright\nowner must still demonstrate that the provider has infringed, and the provider may still\navail itself of any of the defenses, such as fair use, that are available to copyright\ndefendants generally. (Section 512(l)).\nIn addition to limiting the liability of service providers, Title II establishes a\nprocedure by which a copyright owner can obtain a subpoena from a federal court\nordering a service provider to disclose the identity of a subscriber who is allegedly\nengaging in infringing activities. (Section 512(h)).\nSection 512 also contains a provision to ensure that service providers are not\nplaced in the position of choosing between limitations on liability on the one hand and\npreserving the privacy of their subscribers, on the other. Subsection (m) explicitly\nstates that nothing in section 512 requires a service provider to monitor its service or\naccess material in violation of law (such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act)\nin order to be eligible for any of the liability limitations.\nEligibility for Limitations Generally\nA party seeking the benefit of the limitations on liability in Title II must qualify\nas a \u201cservice provider.\u201d For purposes of the first limitation, relating to transitory\ncommunications, \u201cservice provider\u201d is defined in section 512(k)(1)(A) as \u201can entity\noffering the transmission, routing, or providing of connections for digital online\ncommunications, between or among points specified by a user, of material of the user\u2019s\nchoosing, without modification to the content of the material as sent or received.\u201d For\npurposes of the other three limitations, \u201cservice provider\u201d is more broadly defined in\nsection 512(k)(l)(B) as \u201ca provider of online services or network access, or the operator\nof facilities therefor.\u201d\nIn addition, to be eligible for any of the limitations, a service provider must\nmeet two overall conditions: (1) it must adopt and reasonably implement a policy of\nterminating in appropriate circumstances the accounts of subscribers who are repeat\ninfringers; and (2) it must accommodate and not interfere with \u201cstandard technical\nmeasures.\u201d (Section 512(i)). \u201cStandard technical measures\u201d are defined as measures\nthat copyright owners use to identify or protect copyrighted works, that have been\ndeveloped pursuant to a broad consensus of copyright owners and service providers\nin an open, fair and voluntary multi-industry process, are available to anyone on\nCopyright Office Summary December 1998 Page 9\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998\nreasonable nondiscriminatory terms, and do not impose substantial costs or burdens\non service providers.\nLimitation for Transitory Communications\nIn general terms, section 512(a) limits the liability of service providers in\ncircumstances where the provider merely acts as a data conduit, transmitting digital\ninformation from one point on a network to another at someone else\u2019s request. This\nlimitation covers acts of transmission, routing, or providing connections for the\ninformation, as well as the intermediate and transient copies that are made automatically\nin the operation of a network.\nIn order to qualify for this limitation, the service provider\u2019s activities must meet\nthe following conditions:\n! The transmission must be initiated by a person other than the provider.\n! The transmission, routing, provision of connections, or copying must\nbe carried out by an automatic technical process without selection of\nmaterial by the service provider.\n! The service provider must not determine the recipients of the material.\n! Any intermediate copies must not ordinarily be accessible to anyone\nother than anticipated recipients, and must not be retained for longer\nthan reasonably necessary.\n! The material must be transmitted with no modification to its content.\nLimitation for System Caching\nSection 512(b) limits the liability of service providers for the practice of\nretaining copies, for a limited time, of material that has been made available online by\na person other than the provider, and then transmitted to a subscriber at his or her\ndirection. The service provider retains the material so that subsequent requests for the\nsame material can be fulfilled by transmitting the retained copy, rather than retrieving\nthe material from the original source on the network.\nThe benefit of this practice is that it reduces the service provider\u2019s bandwidth\nrequirements and reduces the waiting time on subsequent requests for the same\ninformation. On the other hand, it can result in the delivery of outdated information\nto subscribers and can deprive website operators of accurate \u201chit\u201d information \u2014\ninformation about the number of requests for particular material on a website \u2014 from\nwhich advertising revenue is frequently calculated. For this reason, the person making\nthe material available online may establish rules about updating it, and may utilize\ntechnological means to track the number of \u201chits.\u201d\nCopyright Office Summary December 1998 Page 10\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998\nThe limitation applies to acts of intermediate and temporary storage, when\ncarried out through an automatic technical process for the purpose of making the\nmaterial available to subscribers who subsequently request it. It is subject to the\nfollowing conditions:\n! The content of the retained material must not be modified.\n! The provider must comply with rules about \u201crefreshing\u201d mate-\nrial\u2014replacing retained copies of material with material from the\noriginal location\u2014 when specified in accordance with a generally\naccepted industry standard data communication protocol.\n! The provider must not interfere with technology that returns \u201chit\u201d\ninformation to the person who posted the material, where such\ntechnology meets certain requirements.\n! The provider must limit users\u2019 access to the material in accordance with\nconditions on access (e.g., password protection) imposed by the person\nwho posted the material.\n! Any material that was posted without the copyright owner\u2019s authoriza-\ntion must be removed or blocked promptly once the service provider\nhas been notified that it has been removed, blocked, or ordered to be\nremoved or blocked, at the originating site.\nLimitation for Information Residing on Systems or Networks at the\nDirection of Users\nSection 512(c) limits the liability of service providers for infringing material on\nwebsites (or other information repositories) hosted on their systems. It applies to\nstorage at the direction of a user. In order to be eligible for the limitation, the\nfollowing conditions must be met:\n! The provider must not have the requisite level of knowledge of the\ninfringing activity, as described below.\n! If the provider has the right and ability to control the infringing activity,\nit must not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the\ninfringing activity.\n! Upon receiving proper notification of claimed infringement, the\nprovider must expeditiously take down or block access to the material.\nIn addition, a service provider must have filed with the Copyright Office a\ndesignation of an agent to receive notifications of claimed infringement. The Office\nprovides a suggested form for the purpose of designating an agent\n(http://www.loc.gov/copyright/onlinesp/) and maintains a list of agents on the\nCopyright Office website (http://www.loc.gov/copyright/onlinesp/list/).\nCopyright Office Summary December 1998 Page 11\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998\nUnder the knowledge standard, a service provider is eligible for the limitation\non liability only if it does not have actual knowledge of the infringement, is not aware\nof facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent, or upon gaining\nsuch knowledge or awareness, responds expeditiously to take the material down or\nblock access to it.\nThe statute also establishes procedures for proper notification, and rules as to\nits effect. (Section 512(c)(3)). Under the notice and takedown procedure, a copyright\nowner submits a notification under penalty of perjury, including a list of specified\nelements, to the service provider\u2019s designated agent. Failure to comply substantially\nwith the statutory requirements means that the notification will not be considered in\ndetermining the requisite level of knowledge by the service provider. If, upon receiving\na proper notification, the service provider promptly removes or blocks access to the\nmaterial identified in the notification, the provider is exempt from monetary liability.\nIn addition, the provider is protected from any liability to any person for claims based\non its having taken down the material. (Section 512(g)(1)).\nIn order to protect against the possibility of erroneous or fraudulent\nnotifications, certain safeguards are built into section 512. Subsection (g)(1) gives the\nsubscriber the opportunity to respond to the notice and takedown by filing a counter\nnotification. In order to qualify for the protection against liability for taking down\nmaterial, the service provider must promptly notify the subscriber that it has removed\nor disabled access to the material. If the subscriber serves a counter notification\ncomplying with statutory requirements, including a statement under penalty of perjury\nthat the material was removed or disabled through mistake or misidentification, then\nunless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the subscriber,\nthe service provider must put the material back up within 10-14 business days after\nreceiving the counter notification.\nPenalties are provided for knowing material misrepresentations in either a\nnotice or a counter notice. Any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that\nmaterial is infringing, or that it was removed or blocked through mistake or misidentifi-\ncation, is liable for any resulting damages (including costs and attorneys\u2019 fees) incurred\nby the alleged infringer, the copyright owner or its licensee, or the service provider.\n(Section 512(f)).\nLimitation for Information Location Tools\nSection 512(d) relates to hyperlinks, online directories, search engines and the\nlike. It limits liability for the acts of referring or linking users to a site that contains\ninfringing material by using such information location tools, if the following conditions\nare met:\nCopyright Office Summary December 1998 Page 12\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998\n! The provider must not have the requisite level of knowledge that the\nmaterial is infringing. The knowledge standard is the same as under the\nlimitation for information residing on systems or networks.\n! If the provider has the right and ability to control the infringing activity,\nthe provider must not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to\nthe activity.\n! Upon receiving a notification of claimed infringement, the provider\nmust expeditiously take down or block access to the material.\nThese are essentially the same conditions that apply under the previous\nlimitation, with some differences in the notification requirements. The provisions\nestablishing safeguards against the possibility of erroneous or fraudulent notifications,\nas discussed above, as well as those protecting the provider against claims based on\nhaving taken down the material apply to this limitation. (Sections 512(f)-(g)).\nSpecial Rules Regarding Liability of Nonprofit Educational Institutions\nSection 512(e) determines when the actions or knowledge of a faculty member\nor graduate student employee who is performing a teaching or research function may\naffect the eligibility of a nonprofit educational institution for one of the four limitations\non liability. As to the limitations for transitory communications or system caching, the\nfaculty member or student shall be considered a \u201cperson other than the provider,\u201d so\nas to avoid disqualifying the institution from eligibility. As to the other limitations, the\nknowledge or awareness of the faculty member or student will not be attributed to the\ninstitution. The following conditions must be met:\n! the faculty member or graduate student\u2019s infringing activities do not\ninvolve providing online access to course materials that were required\nor recommended during the past three years;\n! the institution has not received more than two notifications over the\npast three years that the faculty member or graduate student was\ninfringing; and\n! the institution provides all of its users with informational materials\ndescribing and promoting compliance with copyright law.\nTITLE III: COMPUTER MAINTENANCE OR REPAIR\nTitle III expands the existing exemption relating to computer programs in\nsection 117 of the Copyright Act, which allows the owner of a copy of a program to\nmake reproductions or adaptations when necessary to use the program in conjunction\nwith a computer. The amendment permits the owner or lessee of a computer to make\nor authorize the making of a copy of a computer program in the course of maintaining\nor repairing that computer. The exemption only permits a copy that is made\nautomatically when a computer is activated, and only if the computer already lawfully\nCopyright Office Summary December 1998 Page 13\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998\ncontains an authorized copy of the program. The new copy cannot be used in any\nother manner and must be destroyed immediately after the maintenance or repair is\ncompleted.\nTITLE IV: MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\nClarification of the Authority of the Copyright Office\nSection 401(b), adds language to section 701 of the Copyright Act confirming\nthe Copyright Office\u2019s authority to continue to perform the policy and international\nfunctions that it has carried out for decades under its existing general authority.\nEphemeral Recordings for Broadcasters\nSection 112 of the Copyright Act grants an exemption for the making of\n\u201cephemeral recordings.\u201d These are recordings made in order to facilitate a transmis-\nsion. Under this exemption, for example, a radio station can record a set of songs and\nbroadcast from the new recording rather than from the original CDs (which would\nhave to be changed \u201con the fly\u201d during the course of a broadcast).\nAs it existed prior to enactment of the DMCA, section 112 permitted a\ntransmitting organization to make and retain for up to six months (hence the term\n\u201cephemeral\u201d) no more than one copy of a work if it was entitled to transmit a public\nperformance or display of the work, either under a license or by virtue of the fact that\nthere is no general public performance right in sound recordings (as distinguished from\nmusical works).\nThe Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995 (DPRA)\ncreated, for the first time in U.S. copyright law, a limited public performance right in\nsound recordings. The right only covers public performances by means of digital\ntransmission and is subject to an exemption for digital broadcasts (i.e., transmissions\nby FCC licensed terrestrial broadcast stations) and a statutory license for certain\nsubscription transmissions that are not made on demand (i.e. in response to the specific\nrequest of a recipient).\nSection 402 of the DMCA expands the section 112 exemption to include\nrecordings that are made to facilitate the digital transmission of a sound recording\nwhere the transmission is made under the DPRA\u2019s exemption for digital broadcasts or\nstatutory license. As amended, section 112 also permits in some circumstances the\ncircumvention of access control technologies in order to enable an organization to\nmake an ephemeral recording.\nCopyright Office Summary December 1998 Page 14\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998\nDistance Education Study\nIn the course of consideration of the DMCA, legislators expressed an interest\nin amending the Copyright Act to promote distance education, possibly through an\nexpansion of the existing exception for instructional broadcasting in section 110(2).\nSection 403 of the DMCA directs the Copyright Office to consult with affected parties\nand make recommendations to Congress on how to promote distance education\nthrough digital technologies. The Office must report to Congress within six months\nof enactment.\nThe Copyright Office is directed to consider the following issues:\n! The need for a new exemption;\n! Categories of works to be included in any exemption;\n! Appropriate quantitative limitations on the portions of works that may\nbe used under any exemption;\n! Which parties should be eligible for any exemption;\n! Which parties should be eligible recipients of distance education\nmaterial under any exemption;\n! The extent to which use of technological protection measures should\nbe mandated as a condition of eligibility for any exemption;\n! The extent to which the availability of licenses should be considered in\nassessing eligibility for any exemption; and\n! Other issues as appropriate.\nExemption for Nonprofit Libraries and Archives\nSection 404 of the DMCA amends the exemption for nonprofit libraries and\narchives in section 108 of the Copyright Act to accommodate digital technologies and\nevolving preservation practices. Prior to enactment of the DMCA, section 108\npermitted such libraries and archives to make a single facsimile (i.e., not digital) copy\nof a work for purposes of preservation or interlibrary loan. As amended, section 108\npermits up to three copies, which may be digital, provided that digital copies are not\nmade available to the public outside the library premises. In addition, the amended\nsection permits such a library or archive to copy a work into a new format if the\noriginal format becomes obsolete\u2014that is, the machine or device used to render the\nwork perceptible is no longer manufactured or is no longer reasonably available in the\ncommercial marketplace.\nWebcasting Amendments to the Digital Performance Right in Sound\nRecordings\nAs discussed above, in 1995 Congress enacted the DPRA, creating a\nperformance right in sound recordings that is limited to digital transmissions. Under\nCopyright Office Summary December 1998 Page 15\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998\nthat legislation, three categories of digital transmissions were addressed: broadcast\ntransmissions, which were exempted from the performance right; subscription\ntransmissions, which were generally subject to a statutory license; and on-demand\ntransmissions, which were subject to the full exclusive right. Broadcast transmissions\nunder the DPRA are transmissions made by FCC-licensed terrestrial broadcast stations.\nIn the past several years, a number of entities have begun making digital\ntransmissions of sound recordings over the Internet using streaming audio technolo-\ngies. This activity does not fall squarely within any of the three categories that were\naddressed in the DPRA. Section 405 of the DMCA amends the DPRA, expanding the\nstatutory license for subscription transmissions to include webcasting as a new category\nof \u201celigible nonsubscription transmissions.\u201d\nIn addition to expanding the scope of the statutory license, the DMCA revises\nthe criteria that any entity must meet in order to be eligible for the license (other than\nthose who are subject to a grandfather clause, leaving the existing criteria intact). It\nrevises the considerations for setting rates as well (again, subject to a grandfather\nclause), directing arbitration panels convened under the law to set the royalty rates at\nfair market value.\nThis provision of the DMCA also creates a new statutory license for making\nephemeral recordings. As indicated above, section 402 of the DMCA amends section\n112 of the Copyright Act to permit the making of a single ephemeral recording to\nfacilitate the digital transmission of sound recording that is permitted either under the\nDPRA\u2019s broadcasting exemption or statutory license. Transmitting organizations that\nwish to make more than the single ephemeral recording of a sound recording that is\npermitted under the outright exemption in section 112 are now eligible for a statutory\nlicense to make such additional ephemeral recordings. In addition, the new statutory\nlicense applies to the making of ephemeral recordings by transmitting organizations\nother than broadcasters who are exempt from the digital performance right, who are\nnot covered by the expanded exemption in section 402 of the DMCA.\nAssumption of Contractual Obligations upon Transfers of Rights in\nMotion Pictures\nSection 416 addresses concerns about the ability of writers, directors and screen\nactors to obtain residual payments for the exploitation of motion pictures in situations\nwhere the producer is no longer able to make these payments. The guilds\u2019 collective\nbargaining agreements currently require producers to obtain assumption agreements\nfrom distributors in certain circumstances, by which the distributor assumes the\nproducer\u2019s obligation to make such residual payments. Some production companies\napparently do not always do so, leaving the guilds without contractual privity enabling\nthem to seek recourse from the distributor.\nCopyright Office Summary December 1998 Page 16\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998\nThe DMCA adds a new chapter to Title 28 of the U.S. Code that imposes on\ntransferees those obligations to make residual payments that the producer would be\nrequired to have the transferee assume under the relevant collective bargaining\nagreement. The obligations attach only if the distributor knew or had reason to know\nthat the motion picture was produced subject to a collective bargaining agreement, or\nin the event of a court order confirming an arbitration award under the collective\nbargaining agreement that the producer cannot satisfy within ninety days. There are\ntwo classes of transfers that are excluded from the scope of this provision. The first\nis transfers limited to public performance rights, and the second is grants of security\ninterests, along with any subsequent transfers from the security interest holder.\nThe provision also directs the Comptroller General, in consultation with the\nRegister of Copyrights, to conduct a study on the conditions in the motion picture\nindustry that gave rise to this provision, and the impact of the provision on the\nindustry. The study is due two years from enactment.\nTITLE V: PROTECTION OF CERTAIN ORIGINAL DESIGNS\nTitle V of the DMCA, entitled the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act\n(VHDPA), adds a new chapter 13 to Title 17 of the U.S. Code. It creates a new system\nfor protecting original designs of certain useful articles that make the article attractive\nor distinctive in appearance. For purposes of the VHDPA, \u201cuseful articles\u201d are limited\nto the hulls (including the decks) of vessels no longer than 200 feet.\nA design is protected under the VHDPA as soon as a useful article embodying\nthe design is made public or a registration for the design is published. Protection is lost\nif an application for registration is not made within two years after a design is first made\npublic, but a design is not registrable if it has been made public more than one year\nbefore the date of the application for registration. Once registered, protection\ncontinues for ten years from the date protection begins.\nThe VHDPA is subject to a legislative sunset: the Act expires two years from\nenactment (October 28, 2000). The Copyright Office is directed to conduct two joint\nstudies with the Patent and Trademark Office\u2014the first by October 28, 1999 and the\nsecond by October 28, 2000\u2014evaluating the impact of the VHDPA.\nEFFECTIVE DATES\nMost provisions of the DMCA are effective on the date of enactment. There\nare, however, several exceptions. The technical amendments in Title I that relate to\neligibility of works for protection under U.S. copyright law by virtue of the new WIPO\ntreaties do not take effect until the relevant treaty comes into force. Similarly,\nrestoration of copyright protection for such works does not become effective until the\nrelevant treaty comes into force. The prohibition on the act of circumvention of access\nCopyright Office Summary December 1998 Page 17\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998\ncontrol measures does not take effect until two years from enactment (October 28,\n2000).\nF\nCopyright Office Summary December 1998 Page 18\n"

Preamble\n\"Academic institutions exist for the transmission of knowledge, the pursuit of truth, the\ndevelopment of students, and the general well-being of society. Free inquiry and free\nexpression are indispensable to the attainment of these goals ... The responsibility to secure\nand to respect general conditions conducive to the freedom to learn is shared by all members\nof the academic community. Each college and university has a duty to develop policies and\nprocedures which provide and safeguard this freedom.\"\n- Excerpt from the American Association of University Professors (\u201cAAUP\u201d) Joint Statement on\nRights and Freedoms of Students\nB. Context\nThis document is the basis for university-wide policies and practices for the acceptable use\nand management of all University of Hawai\u2018i (\u201cUH\u201d or \u201cUniversity\u201d) information technology\nresources. It is intended to define and provide effective protection, equal access, and\nadministrative guidelines for the use of those resources. The purpose of these guidelines is not\nto replace but to supplement existing laws, regulations, general codes of conduct, agreements,\nand contracts that are currently in place.\nIn support of its mission of teaching, research, and public service, and within its institutional\npriorities and financial capabilities, the University provides access to computing, network and\ninformation systems and services for the students, faculty and staff who form the basis of the\nUH community. Collectively, these computing, network and information systems and services\ncomprise the institution\u2019s information technology infrastructure. The University strives to create\nan intellectual environment in which its community can effectively access and create\ninformation and collaborate with colleagues both within the UH system and at other institutions.\nEP 2.210\nPage 3 of 17\nAs it does so, the University is committed to maintaining an information environment that is\nfree of harassment and discrimination and is accessible to all members of its community. Such\nan environment can only exist when the users and managers of the information technologies\nbehave responsibly and respectfully.\nThis policy creates the basis for such an environment by outlining the philosophy and general\nprinciples for appropriate use and management of information technology resources by\nUniversity faculty, staff and students. It applies to all computing, information and network\nsystems and services owned, developed, procured, or administered by the University, as well\nas to individual activities that take place over the Internet or other external network\nconnections using University systems, connections or user accounts, in conducting University\nbusiness.\nAppropriate use of technological resources is framed by the same legal and ethical\nconsiderations as are applicable to other public resources. Access to UH networks and\ncomputer systems is a privilege granted subject to existing University policies, as well as all\napplicable local, state, and federal laws, e.g., copyright law, child pornography prohibitions,\ncomputer crime statutes.\nThe University requires that all its students, faculty, staff and approved guests abide by these\npolicies. In addition, users of specific technology resources and services that are provided in\ncooperation with larger communities or third parties, e.g., the Internet, must also adhere to\ncodes of conduct which the University accepts implicitly or explicitly on behalf of all its users.\nThe University strives to inform all users of these policies, but users are responsible for their\nown actions. The University accepts no responsibility or liability for the specific acts of\nindividuals that violate this or any other authorized policy, code of conduct or statute.\nFor informational purposes, the computer crime statute from Hawai\u2018i\u2019s penal code is included\nherein as Appendix A and portions of the State Ethics Code are included as Appendix B.\nC. Responsible Use\n1. Privileges and Responsibilities\nThe University defines and provides access to institutional computers, information\nsystems and networks as a privilege rather than a right. Reliable and safe access to the\nUniversity's information resources requires that users accept their responsibilities to\nbehave in ways that protect the community, and by so doing they also preserve their\nown access.\nAll users must respect the rights of others, the integrity of the facilities and controls\nwhich are implemented to maximize the community\u2019s reliable access, and all pertinent\nlicense and contractual agreements that underlie the University\u2019s technology\ninfrastructure. It is the policy of the University to deny access to any member of the user\nEP 2.210\nPage 4 of 17\ncommunity who violates this policy or who uses the University\u2019s technology resources to\nviolate other duly established policies or laws.\n2. Principles of Responsible Use, with Examples\nAll users have the responsibility to operate the University computing systems in an\nethical, lawful and responsible manner. These principles of responsible use are derived\ndirectly from standards of decency and common sense that apply to the use of any\nshared public resource. They apply equally to users who are students, faculty, staff or\nany authorized guest user of the University\u2019s systems, networks and services. Each of\nthe following principles includes examples of prohibited behaviors. These examples are\nintended to illustrate the range of unacceptable actions rather than to exhaustively\nelaborate all specific behaviors that may violate the principle.\n1. Users must adamantly protect their personal passwords\nPasswords are the basic security mechanism which authenticate individuals as\neligible to use University resources. The username and password also\nauthorize individuals to perform specific actions based on the identity of the\nuser, such as permitting students to drop classes or faculty to view class lists.\nUnauthorized use of someone else\u2019s password is strictly prohibited, and may\nconstitute violation of law and well as standards of conduct.\nPasswords should be chosen that are difficult to guess and should not be\nwritten down. Experts recommend changing passwords on a regular basis.\nUnder no circumstances should a password be shared with a family member,\nfriend or acquaintance, much less any stranger or caller. Appendix C contains a\nguide to the selection and management of personal passwords. Users should\nimmediately report any suspected unauthorized use of their username to their\nsystem administrator.\n2. Users must respect the privacy of others\u2019 passwords, information and\ncommunication, and may not attempt to use University resources to gain\nunauthorized access to any site or network or to maliciously compromise the\nperformance of internal or external systems or networks. Digital environments\npresent certain new opportunities for abuse, but the infractions and\nconsequences are often comparable to those in the physical world. Just as an\nunlocked door is not an invitation to theft, everything that is technically possible\nis not permissible or legal.\nUsers must not store or run programs intended to obtain others\u2019 passwords.\nUsers must not look over others\u2019 shoulders to try to obtain passwords or\notherwise try to obtain unauthorized access to the information or\ncommunication of others. Users may not \u201csniff\u201d networks or undertake\ncomparable measures to obtain access to passwords or other information not\nEP 2.210\nPage 5 of 17\nmade publicly available by the owner. Users may not attempt to gain\nunauthorized access to other systems, networks and services external to the\nUniversity via the University\u2019s Internet or other network connections. Nor may\nprograms be stored or executed that attempt to gain unauthorized system-level\naccess to computers or network devices either inside or external to the\nUniversity.\nUsers may not store or execute programs or engage in or abet any activities\ndesigned to test or compromise system or network performance without the\nprior written authorization of the responsible system administrator(s). This\nincludes programs that introduce a virus, worm or other destructive/disruptive\nprograms. Users may not launch \u201cdenial-of-service\u201d attacks against internal or\nexternal systems and networks from within the University.\nViolations of this policy may also be subject to prosecution under the federal\nElectronic Communications Privacy Act (\u201cECPA\u201d) of 1986, as amended, which\nprotects the confidentiality of personal electronic communications or the Hawai\u2018i\nPenal Code provisions for computer crime. Under no circumstances will\nexcuses be accepted that such behaviors were intended purely for educational\npurposes or to help system administrators improve security.\n3. No individual may falsely represent themselves or \"spoof\" another physical\nnetwork connection\nViolations of laws, codes of conduct or usage policies are usually attempted\nunder false identities. Academic integrity dictates that members of the\nUniversity community be accountable for their actions. Users may not attempt\nto represent their network activities as originating from a network address other\nthan the actual source, i.e., \u201cspoofing\u201d. Nor should users falsely identify\nthemselves in their email or postings. There are legitimate uses for anonymity\nin certain specific communications forums, but it is generally not considered\nappropriate in most on- line discourse.\n4. Users must observe all laws relating to copyright, trademark, export and\nintellectual property rights.\nIntellectual property is the lifeblood of a university, and all members of the\nuniversity community should respect the work of others inside and outside the\nacademy. Software may not be duplicated or installed except in strict\naccordance with applicable licensing agreements. Software not eligible for\nexport may not be freely stored on University systems or transmitted outside\nthe U.S. And University servers and networks may not be used to house or\ndistribute unauthorized software, music, video or other information resources.\nThe University will actively participate in the prosecution of members of the\nEP 2.210\nPage 6 of 17\ncommunity who violate the law, for example, by mounting illegal music or\nsoftware distribution servers using University resources.\nThe University adopts the EDUCOM Code, a statement on Software and\nIntellectual Rights, incorporated herein as Appendix D. EDUCAUSE, which has\nsince incorporated EDUCOM and its programs, is a non-profit consortium of\ncolleges and universities committed to the use and management of information\ntechnology for teaching and learning.\nPursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Pub. L. No. 105-304, 112\nStat. 2860 (1998), as amended, notifications of claimed infringement using\nUniversity of Hawaii services should be filed with:\nInformation Technology Services\nUniversity of Hawai\u2018i\n2520 Correa Road\nHonolulu, HI 96822\nTel: 808-956-3501\nFax: 808-956-7322\nEmail: dmca-agent@hawaii.edu\n5. Users must ensure that their electronic communications do not infringe the\nrights of others and are conducted in accord with the same standards of\nbehavior that apply in other forms of communication\nThe privilege of Internet access offers numerous opportunities to interact with\nothers all over the world. As an institution of higher education the University\nsupports open and unrestricted communication by members of its community.\nHowever, many people have a tendency to send email, post messages, or\nengage in other behaviors that they would never think to perform in person.\nElectronic communication may lack the visual and verbal cues such as a smile\nor tone-of-voice that indicate when someone is joking, so misinterpretation may\nbe more likely than in-person. For this reason, it is suggested that people\nexercise even more care in their on-line communication than face-to-face.\nThe same legal and policy standards that define intimidation, harassment or\ninvasion of privacy apply to the electronic environment. For example,\npersistence in sending unwanted email constitutes harassment and is\nunacceptable if not illegal. Display of sexually explicit images or sounds where\nothers can see or hear them may create a hostile environment and could\nconstitute sexual harassment according to University policies on sexual\nharassment. And obscene email is comparable to obscene phone calls or\nletters. Laws relating to child pornography, obscenity and defamation apply in\nelectronic environments and the University strictly prohibits the use of its\ninformation technology resources for downloading pornography or other such\nEP 2.210\nPage 7 of 17\nillegal conduct. The University will willingly cooperate in the prosecution of\nindividuals formally charged with such offenses.\nFinally, users should be aware that each specific on-line forum or mailing list\nmight have specific standards of content and behavior to which its members\nare expected to adhere. These may range from \u201cno anonymous messages\u201d to\n\u201cno posting of job ads on this mailing list.\u201d The University will cooperate in\nhelping the managers of external forums enforce their standards, just as we\nexpect other institutions to cooperate in helping members of the UH community\nmanage their forums based on the public standards of behavior established for\ntheir group.\n6. University resources are intended to be used for institutional purposes and may\nnot be used for private gain.\nThe University provides information technology resources at great expense for\nthe purpose of supporting its mission (learning, teaching, research, and public\nservice). It is expected that usage will be primarily educational in nature in\nsupport of this mission.\nAll applicable laws and policies relating to the ethical use of public resources\napply to University information technologies as well. The Hawai\u2018i State Ethics\nCode prohibits use of University resources for private business purposes (see\nAppendix B) and under no circumstances may individuals use institutional\ntechnology resources for commercial purposes without prior written\nauthorization. This includes activities such as the use of University email or\nweb sites for marketing a home business, hosting a commercial home page, or\nproviding friends who are not members of the University community with\naccess to institutional equipment and services. Users may not run private\nservers or bulletin board systems for non-University purposes through\nUniversity networks or provide such connectivity to others. Political\ncampaigning may not be engaged in using the University\u2019s electronic\ninformation systems\n7. Users may not engage in activities which compromise institutional systems or\nnetwork performance for others\nThe University administers its technology resources on a shared-use basis for\nthe benefit of the entire community. This is only possible when all members of\nthe community respect the need of others for services. In addition, portions of\nthe Internet itself may be vulnerable to disruptions in service by malicious\nactivities. As a whole, the Internet protects itself through an informal and\nevolving code of behavior among system administrators. The University of\nHawaii is committed to be a good institutional citizen of the Internet, noting that\nnon-cooperating institutions are sometimes blacklisted from certain services\nEP 2.210\nPage 8 of 17\nwhich could prevent members of the University community from achieving their\nlegitimate academic requirements.\nAs a general rule, the University tries to be permissive rather than prohibitive in\nthese matters, but certain behaviors by individuals can compromise the\navailability and reliability of services for the entire community. Examples of\nsuch activities include the unauthorized running of \u201cserver\u201d programs on\ninstitutional systems or hosting non-educational web sites intended to do\nnothing more than generate high \u201chit counts.\u201d Nothing in this section is intended\nto discourage faculty or staff from operating authorized servers in a responsible\nmanner in support of the mission of the University. While it attempts to manage\nresources on a content-neutral basis, the University does reserve the right to\ncurtail specific uses of its technology infrastructure that unduly interfere with the\ninstitution\u2019s ability to provide the best possible service to the overall community.\nUsers may not engage in the transmission of unsolicited bulk email\n(\u201cspamming\u201d), regardless of how important it may seem to the sender. Email is\na form of individual communication, not a public forum, and should not be used\nto express opinions or forward views to those who have not expressed a wish\nto engage in the dialog. This policy shall in no way limit the use of email as a\nlegitimate means for the University community to share information and\ncommunication.\nUnder no circumstances may users create, transmit or forward electronic chain\nletters. Chain letters are often social notes, wishes of good fortune or most\ninsidiously, bogus virus warnings which request the recipient to forward the\nmessage to friends and colleagues ad infinitum. Such notes can have a\nsignificant and consequential impact on institutional resources as they are\nforwarded around University systems. Users may not initiate or participate in\nthe targeting of a particular person or system with mass quantities of email\n(\"mail bombs\u201d). In the paper world junk mailers bear the full costs of such\nactivities when they choose to buy a stamp and envelope, but with University\nemail the costs are borne by the entire community and the taxpayers of the\nState.\nActivities such as spam, chain letters, and mail bombs degrade performance of\nnetworks and systems, may violate agreements with third parties such as the\nUniversity\u2019s Internet Service Providers, and may even endanger the availability\nof the email services for the entire institution. Violations may be cause for the\nrevocation of the offender\u2019s access to University resources.\nD. Confidentiality and Security of Electronic Information\nThe University strives to maximize the confidentiality and security of its information systems\nand services within the limitations of available resources. As with paper-based systems, no\nEP 2.210\nPage 9 of 17\ntechnology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. All users should be aware of this fact and\nshould not have an expectation of total privacy regarding information that is created, stored,\nsent or received on any networked system. The most important first line of defense in\ninformation security is the password, and it is for that reason that the University username and\npassword must be adamantly protected as described above. And institutional custodians of\nprivate information should exercise prudence, using secure technologies when appropriate and\nfeasible.\nThe Internet environment offers tremendous opportunities to provide convenient access to\nUniversity information and services to authorized individuals wherever they may be. Users who\nserve as custodians of institutional information should be particularly aware of the potential for\nunauthorized access to or tampering with on-line information and services in the Internet\nenvironment. Techniques such as the use of encryption, secure web servers or restricting\naccess based on specific criteria may be appropriate based on the balance between access\nand security applicable to any specific application or service. Technology administrators are\nresponsible to provide reasonable measures of protection of the underlying technology\nsystems and infrastructure they manage. But risk assessment and risk management strategies\nare the responsibility of the functional custodians of specific information and services, in\nconsultation with technology managers who should describe the specific technical safeguards\nin place.\nE. Ownership and Disclosure of Information\nThe University owns the computers and networks that comprise the institutional information\ntechnology infrastructure. The electronic allocation of file space to a user does not assign legal\nownership of the content. Rather, it is the granting of permission to use these institutional\nfacilities subject to the policies and regulations of the University and applicable statutes.\nCollective bargaining agreements and related University policies govern ownership of\nintellectual property.\nFiles stored on University systems may be subject to disclosure under the U.S. Freedom of\nInformation Act or the Hawai\u2018i Uniform Information Practices Act. In addition, it is the policy of\nthe University to cooperate with all legally empowered investigations initiated by law\nenforcement agencies when presented with a legitimate court order such as a warrant or\nsubpoena. As has been made abundantly clear in highly publicized legal cases, this may\ninclude archives of electronic mail sent or received. In addition, the contents of files on\nUniversity systems may be inspected in the context of a duly authorized University\ninvestigation.\nUsers should be aware that most institutional systems are backed up on a routine basis to\nensure the ability to recover from computer or network failures or disturbances. Backup\nprocedures are generally not designed or intended for long-term storage of files. However, all\nusers should be aware that files or email messages that they have deleted may still persist on\nbackups and may therefore be subject to disclosure in a duly authorized investigation.\nEP 2.210\nPage 10 of 17\nF. Privacy of Student Information\nUniversity computing, information and network resources must be used in a manner consistent\nwith appropriate rules and laws governing the individual privacy of students. This includes the\nFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d) (codified in 20 U.S.C., section 1231g) as\namended; Hawai\u2018i Revised Statutes, Chapter 708-891, 892 and 893; Chapter 20-20, Hawai\u2018i\nAdministrative Rules, entitled \"Protection of Educational Rights and Privacy of Students;\" and\nUH Administrative Procedure A7.022.\nG. Commitment to Access\nThe University is committed to a policy of equal opportunity and nondiscrimination on the basis\nof disability status. Therefore, these policies and procedures ensure that Individuals with\nDisabilities, will not, on the basis of those disabilities, be denied equal access to the\nUniversity\u2019s programs, services, and activities. All University units are responsible for ensuring\nthat the services, programs and activities they provide via information technology resources\nand digital media are as accessible, effective, and timely to Individuals with Disabilities as they\nare to people without disabilities. Each individual or unit responsible for web content must be\naware of this Policy and know how to provide accessible content. Those responsible must also\nmonitor and evaluate the content regularly for accessibility.\nThe University is committed to ensuring equal opportunity for Individuals with Disabilities in\naccordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\u201cADA\u201d), as amended by the ADA\nAmendments Act of 2008, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibits\ndiscrimination on the basis of disability in employment or in the provision of educational\nservices as well as the Higher Education Opportunity Act.\nThis policy applies to all information technology and digital media that is created, purchased,\nused, and implemented by or for any University units and used to carry out any University\nprograms, services and/or activities through websites or web-based applications, software,\nhardware, and electronic documents, except when an exception has been granted. In addition,\nthis Policy applies to all information technology resources and digital media used to conduct\nuniversity business, except information technology resources created or published by students,\nfaculty, or staff for personal use.\nAll web content should be in compliance with Section 508 Standards and should also meet the\nWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA. Additional standards for other\ninformation technology resources may be identified over time and added to this Policy. If an\nIndividual with Disabilities finds the content on any University website inaccessible, they may\nemail itsada@hawaii.edu or call the ITS Help Desk at (808) 956-8883 for assistance.\nPriority for implementation of this policy and standards should be given to programs, services,\nand activities that are either highly critical or are broadly used by the campus, a school, or a\ncollege, taking into account feasibility, funding, technical capacity, and needs of staff training.\nEP 2.210\nPage 11 of 17\nConformance to standards may not always be feasible where compliance is not technically\npossible, is unreasonably expensive or difficult in, or requires fundamental alteration of\nservices, and programs that it may require extraordinary measures due to the nature of the\ninformation technology resources or the intent of the web page. Undue financial and/or\nadministrative burden or non-availability may qualify as an exception from this Policy. It is an\ninstitutional decision to be made by the Deans and Directors after consultation with the Vice\nPresident for Information Technology and Chief Information Officer, the affected unit and\nothers with relevant perspectives or expertise.\nHowever, these difficulties do not relieve University programs, services, and activities from\ntheir accessibility and equal access obligations. After consultation with the Vice President for\nInformation Technology and Chief Information Officer, Deans and Directors must be prepared\nto provide content, services, programs, and/or activity in equally effective alternative format\nand/or access upon request.\nRights and Responsibilities\n1. Information Technology Services (\u201cITS\u201d)\nITS recognizes the responsibility to identify and maintain the academic and\ntechnical standards that are fundamental to providing quality resources while\nensuring the rights of persons with disabilities. To meet this obligation, ITS:\na. Has the responsibility to ensure that all of its resources, viewed in their\nentirety, are accessible;\nb. Has the right to select among equally effective methods of\naccommodating Individuals with Disabilities;\nc. Has the right to refer Individuals with Disabilities to the appropriate agency\nwith requests for accommodations that exceed those currently possible at\nITS;\nd. Has the right to deny a request for services for Individuals with Disabilities.\nIf a request is denied, ITS has the responsibility to inform the individual of\nthe reasons for the denial.\n2. Individuals with Disabilities\nIndividuals with Disabilities have the right to an equal opportunity to use and\nbenefit from the resources that ITS has to offer. To ensure this right,\nIndividuals with Disabilities:\na. Have the responsibility to identify themselves as needing appropriate,\nreasonable accommodations;\nb. Have the responsibility for making their needs known in a timely manner;\nc. Have the same obligation as any other UH faculty, staff, or student to\ncomply with University policy and procedures;\nEP 2.210\nPage 12 of 17\nd. Have the responsibility to follow standard UH policies and procedures;\ne. Have the right to confidentiality of all information regarding their disability.\nIndividuals with Disabilities have the right to choose to who information\nabout their disability will be disclosed.\nIn addition to the provisions contained herein, separate guidelines shall be established\nconcerning accessible technology and digital media and procurement of information\ntechnology goods and services.\nH. Special Responsibilities of System and Network Administrators\nAdministrators of information technology bear a heavy responsibility to maximize the\navailability and utility of the systems they manage while at the same time honoring individual\nusers\u2019 justifiable expectations of an information and communications environment that is \u201csafe\u201d\nfor its users. In addition to having all the responsibilities of any other user as described above,\nsystem administrators are granted certain system privileges which make it possible for them to\nmanage the technical resources under their control. System privileges may permit access to\ninitial passwords, files, voice mail, telephone or electronic communication, and information\nabout individual usage patterns. These privileges are necessary for doing their jobs, but have\ntremendous potential for abuse as well. Such abuse is a violation of University policy and this\nsection outlines the unique responsibilities and obligations of system and network\nadministrators.\nThese special responsibilities accompany the granting of any network or system privileges to\nany member of the University community, whether faculty, student or staff. System\nadministrators to whom this applies include individuals who administer departmental, college\nor institutional servers; individuals who administer network devices such as modems and\nrouters; individuals responsible for telephone services; and individuals who have any level of\nprivileged access to institutional information systems. Under no circumstances will abuse of\nsystem privileges be tolerated and violations will be considered as legitimate cause for\ndisciplinary action up to and including termination and/or legal prosecution. Individuals who are\nnot willing to accept these responsibilities should not be in positions which require system\nprivileges in order to perform their duties.\nIn addition, individual systems and servers can be carelessly mismanaged not only to the\ndetriment of the users of that system or service but to the detriment of the entire institution.\nBefore making the decision to install a server, the responsible administrator should be\nprepared to commit the time and resources necessary to ensure proper management. This\nincludes designation of a professional system administrator who will have the time and\nexpertise to understand the technical implications of their systems, maintain current on\nvulnerabilities, software patches and new releases, and be able to address urgent issues on\nan immediate basis. Failure to do so may endanger not only the integrity of services provided\nto one\u2019s own users but to the institution as a whole. The University will not hesitate to\ndisconnect improperly managed systems that endanger the integrity of institutional networks,\nEP 2.210\nPage 13 of 17\nsystems or services and it will be the sole responsibility of the unit\u2019s system administrator or its\nmanagement to remedy the situation.\nWhile the following list is not considered to be all-inclusive, it establishes the framework for\nunacceptable behaviors. University management has the responsibility to ensure that system\nadministrators within their units address these matters and should not permit the establishment\nof servers and services within their units unless they understand the potential for abuse and\naccept responsibility for compliance. And users should be welcomed to discuss any or all of\nthese matters with their system administrators. All perceived violations of these guidelines\nshould be reported to the appropriate dean, director, provost or vice-president.\n1. System administrators shall protect individual passwords\nUsers have the right to expect that their passwords be treated with complete\nconfidentiality. Passwords should never be divulged to a third party except as necessary\nin the course of distributing a new password to a user. System administrators should\ntake the utmost care in how passwords are distributed, striving for the best possible\nbalance between a user\u2019s needs for privacy and convenience. Any time a password is\ntransmitted to a user, the user should be advised to change their password immediately\nto protect against any possible disclosure during the transmission.\n2. System administrators shall not browse, inspect or copy users\u2019 information\nSystem administrators may not browse the contents of user files or messages --\nwhether on-line or from backups -- without the user\u2019s permission. Inspection of\ninformation is permitted only upon specific authorization from a dean, director, provost,\nvice-president or legal authorities as part of a duly authorized investigation or for official\nUniversity business. As a matter of professionalism, system administrators should avoid\ndirect or indirect contact with users\u2019 information and communication content whenever\npossible. In spite of their best efforts system administrators may from time-to-time\nencounter confidential information in the performance of their duties. Under no\ncircumstances should such information be acted upon, divulged, or used for the\npersonal benefit or profit of anyone. Violations of this trust endanger the viability of the\ninstitutional information infrastructure and will not be permitted. However, system\nadministrators may perform routine scans and are encouraged to utilize standard\nsecurity tools to check for potentially damaging or illegal software on institutional\nsystems.\n3. System and network administrators shall not routinely collect information on individuals\u2019\ninformation usage patterns\nThe University expects that the members of its community will access a rich variety of\ninformation and communication resources in the course of their academic activities.\nSystem administrators shall not monitor or collect data regarding the activities of\nindividuals unless specifically authorized to do in the context of a duly authorized\nEP 2.210\nPage 14 of 17\ninvestigation. This is not intended to interfere with the responsibility of system\nadministrators to collect and analyze general anonymous information about the overall\npatterns of usage of information technology resources. Such information is a vital tool in\nensuring the adequacy of the institutional technology environment to meet the needs of\nits users. Nor are system administrators obliged to spend undue efforts disabling the\nroutine logging activities that are built into many server operating systems.\n4. System administrators shall configure software systems so as to maximize the\nconfidentiality of user communication\nAdministrators of email servers in particular bear a responsibility to respect the privacy\nof their users\u2019 communication. Email systems should be configured so as to maximize\nprivacy. For example, email that is rejected for technical reasons should be returned to\nthe sender rather than to the \u201cpostmaster.\u201d And routine error notification messages to\nthe postmaster should contain only message headers, not the message contents. Users\nare encouraged to ask their email administrator how email systems are configured and\nunder what circumstance their email may be disclosed.\n5. System administrators shall configure systems to enforce appropriate password policies\nMost server operating systems have configurable options for password security. System\nadministrators should use these options to comply with the UH password policy in\nAppendix C. In addition, system administrators should ensure that all activities relating\nto security changes are handled in accord with a written policy and are documented\n(e.g., system privileges should not be given to individuals who do not need them to\nperform their job, and the granting of such privileges should be documented).\nProcedures should be in place for emergency access to critical passwords needed in\ncase of system failure when the usual system administrator(s) may not be available.\nThe level of formality and detail of the security policy and practices may be dependent\non the role and importance of specific systems and services.\n6. System administrators shall stay abreast of any vulnerabilities of their systems and\nmanage security in accord with appropriate recommendations\nSystem administrators are responsible for remaining up-to-date at all times with security\nissues relevant to the systems they administer. This may be done through means such\nas their vendors\u2019 information channels or Computer Emergency Response Team\n(\u201cCERT\u201d) bulletins. System administrators are required to use this information to apply\nall recommended security patches in a timely manner.\n7. System administrators should configure their systems to minimize the chance for abuse,\nand act promptly to end abuses upon notification\nCertain kinds of disruptions rely on the naivet\u00e9 of system administrators on the Internet.\nAny perception that the University is a haven for such abusers endangers the ability of\nEP 2.210\nPage 15 of 17\nthe University community to communicate with others. For example, external sites that\nhave been attacked by someone using a University system as the instrument of the\nattack may find that they can only safeguard themselves by blocking all traffic from the\nUniversity. As just two examples of the kinds of measures that should be taken, email\nadministrators should block anonymous email relays through their systems and network\nadministrators should block the forging of IP source addresses from within networks\nthey manage. As noted above, the University will not hesitate to disconnect improperly\nmanaged systems that endanger the integrity of institutional networks, systems or\nservices and it will be the sole responsibility of the unit\u2019s system administrator or its\nmanagement to remedy the situation.\n8. System administrators shall publicize backup policy\nAs noted above, backups present a means by which information may be recovered that\nusers believe to have been deleted. Backup policies determine the persistence of\ndeleted information and therefore users have a right to know the backup policy of all\nsystems they use. System administrators should post this policy or make it easily\navailable to their users upon request.\nI. Due Process\nAll alleged violations of this policy shall be processed according to the principles of due\nprocess, for example, allegations should always be investigated by a party other than the\naccuser. It is the policy of the University to avoid creating unnecessary enforcement\nmechanisms for technology that are different than for other media. Therefore, the authority that\nwould be responsible for comparable infractions shall also be responsible for enforcing\nviolations that take place via technology (e.g., if sexual harassment occurs via technology,\nresponsibility for enforcement shall reside with the same authority that would handle any other\nsexual harassment allegation).\nIn general, when an alleged violation of this policy by a user is encountered, the responsible\nstaff or system administrator shall first notify the user. The user will be expected to take\nimmediate remedial action or respond by indicating that they do not believe they have violated\nthe policy. Depending on the seriousness of the alleged violation, or should the violation\npersist after notification to the user, further investigation and consequent enforcement action\nmay be initiated.\nAllegations of violation of statute or conduct codes will be filed with appropriate internal or\nexternal authorities, typically the Dean of Students, Vice President, or legal authorities. If the\nallegation relates to personal harassment the system administrator should direct the\ncomplainant to file their allegation with the responsible authority. System administrators will\ncooperate fully in duly authorized investigations and should attempt to provide assistance to\naggrieved parties. But System administrators are not obligated to file personal complaints on\nbehalf of aggrieved parties since that decision belongs with the complainant.\nEP 2.210\nPage 16 of 17\nIn cases where the alleged violation relates to endangering the availability or performance of\nthe technology infrastructure (e.g., a denial-of-service attack), authority for investigation and\naction up to and including suspension of access to University technology resources may be\ndelegated to the senior manager responsible for the impacted technology. Inspection of user\nfiles necessary to the investigation should be approved in advance by a Dean, Director,\nChancellor or Vice President. If access to University technology is suspended as a result of the\ninvestigation, the alleged violator may appeal their suspension to the appropriate Chancellor,\nDean, Director or Vice President. Such violations may also be referred to appropriate internal\nor external authorities or for prosecution as a criminal offense or violation of other code of\nconduct.\nAllegations of misconduct by system administrators should be filed with the responsible Dean,\nDirector, Chancellor or Vice President, who shall be responsible for investigating the situation\nby drawing on expertise outside the unit as needed.\nAny and all discipline or appropriate disciplinary actions will be imposed in accordance with the\napplicable collective bargaining agreements. For all included employees covered by collective\nbargaining, appeals of disciplinary actions shall be filed in accordance with the applicable\ncollective bargaining agreement.\nRegardless of its commitment to due process, the University reserves the right to summarily\nsuspend access to facilities and services or take emergency actions as necessary to protect\nthe safety, integrity and performance of its institutional systems and services. Such actions\nmay be necessary due to inadvertent errors or problems unrelated to misconduct by any\nindividual, but system administrators must be able to take certain actions in times of crisis to\npreserve and protect the overall services provided to the University community.\nIV. Delegation of Authority\nVice Presidents, Chancellors, Deans and Directors are hereby directed with the authority to\nimplement this Policy. The Vice President for Information Technology and Chief Information Officer is\nresponsible for issuing and updating any requirements, standards or guidelines that support this\nPolicy and shall facilitate the regular communication with campuses, colleges, departments, and units\nto address consistent implementation of this Policy throughout the University system. For individual or\nunit responsible for web content, help on this Policy can be found on the Information Technology\nAccessibility website (www.hawaii.edu/access) or by utilizing the additional contact information listed\nbelow.\nV.

Purpose\nThe purpose of this executive policy is to ensure that the University of Hawai\u2018i\n(the \u201cUniversity\u201d) complies with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\nof 1996, as amended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009\n(\u201cARRA\u201d), which included the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical\nHealth Act (\u201cHITECH\u201d) that expanded the scope of privacy and security protections, and\nby the implementing regulations at 45 Code of Federal Regulations (\u201cCFR\u201d) Parts 160,\n162 and 164, as amended (collectively referred to as \u201cHIPAA\u201d). The objectives of this\npolicy (hereinafter, \u201cHIPAA Policy\u201d) are to establish University System-wide policies and\nprocedures to:\nA. Designate the University as a Hybrid Entity as defined in HIPAA.\nB. Establish fundamental principles governing the University\u2019s management and\nuse of Protected Health Information (\u201cPHI\u201d) as required by HIPAA, including\nelectronic Protected Health Information (\u201cePHI\u201d) as all such terms are defined\nin HIPAA and as more specifically set forth in paragraphs II.H and T herein.\nC. Establish a set of standardized terms and definitions to promote consistent\ninterpretation and implementation of the University\u2019s HIPAA Policy.\nD. Establish clear lines of authority and accountability related to PHI.\nE. Set forth best practices for HIPAA compliance with the ongoing objectives of:\n1. Identifying University units and subunits (and their activities) that are\nsubject to HIPAA (collectively the \u201cUH Covered Components\u201d) that are\nmore specifically defined in this HIPAA Policy in paragraphs II.V and III.A.\n2. Managing and mitigating information privacy and security risks related to\nPHI.\nThe federal regulations protecting PHI are complex, and this University HIPAA\nPolicy distills those regulations and provides for additional training regarding the\nregulations. An annotated version of the Policy, which contains citations to specific\nregulations, is available from the University System HIPAA Privacy and Security\nOfficer(s) (defined herein and as more specifically set forth in paragraph III.E herein). In\nEP 2.217\nPage 2 of 25\nthe event of any inconsistency between this HIPAA Policy and HIPAA, HIPAA shall\ncontrol. Any questions about this HIPAA Policy may be directed to the \u201cUnit HIPAA\nCoordinator\u201d and the \u201cUH System HIPAA Privacy and Security Officer(s)\u201d (as defined\nherein), or the Chief Information Security Officer or the Office of General Counsel, as\nappropriate.\nThis HIPAA Policy covers PHI, which does not include all health information\ncollected by the University. PHI does not include, for example, information that is\nconsidered education records covered by the Family Educational Right and Privacy Act\n(\u201cFERPA\u201d) and excluded from HIPAA, as well as employment records held by any unit\nor subunit in its role as an employer. Any health information not protected under this\nHIPAA Policy is covered under Executive Policy (\u201cEP\u201d) 2.214, as amended, and other\napplicable University policies, and all University units and subunits maintaining such\nnon-PHI health information must comply with EP 2.214.\nII. Definitions\nThe University adopts and uses the following definitions set forth in HIPAA,\nspecifically including the HIPAA regulations at 45 CFR Parts 160, 162, and 164, as\namended. Capitalized terms are used herein as defined in HIPAA unless the context\nrequires otherwise.\nA. Authorization: A document that is required to be signed by the patient to use\nand disclose specified PHI for specified purposes. (A standard University\nAuthorization template is attached hereto as Attachment 1-A.)\nB. Business Associate: A person or entity (other than an employee of a UH\nCovered Component) who performs a function or activity involving the use or\ndisclosure of PHI on behalf of a Covered Entity, including but not limited to\nclaims processing or administration, data analysis, processing or\nadministration, utilization review, quality assurance, billing, benefit\nmanagement, practice management, re-pricing, legal, actuarial, accounting,\nconsulting, data aggregation, management, administrative, accreditation, or\nfinancial services. Business associates include a health information\norganization, e-prescribing gateway, or other vendors who provide data\ntransmission services that require access to PHI on a routine basis; entities\nthat offer personal health records; and subcontractors that receive PHI on\nbehalf of the business associate. A business associate of one UH Covered\nComponent does not automatically become a business associate of any other\nUH Covered Component.\nC. Consent: A general document that Covered Entities may obtain giving health\ncare providers, which have a direct treatment relationship with a patient,\npermission to use and disclose all PHI to carry out treatment, payment or\nhealth care operations.

Executive Policy\nA. Policy Statement and Designation of UH Covered Components\nThe University is Hawai\u2018i\u2019s statewide higher education system and only public\nuniversity. The University is a body corporate as provided in Article X, Section 5 of the\nHawai\u2018i State Constitution. Pursuant to that authority and as allowed by HIPAA, the\nUniversity designates itself as a Hybrid Entity separate from the State of Hawai\u2018i\nExecutive, Legislative and Judicial branches.\nThe University is committed to complying with HIPAA. The University is a\nsingle legal entity comprised of separate campuses, schools, departments, entities,\nEP 2.217\nPage 6 of 25\nunits and subunits (collectively referred to as \u201cUnits\u201d). Some Units provide Covered\nFunctions as defined in HIPAA and have been designated by the University as \u201cUH\nCovered Components\u201d and other Units perform non-covered functions under HIPAA.\nAccordingly, the University has designated itself as a Hybrid Entity in accordance with\nthe applicable HIPAA regulations. A Hybrid Entity may exclude from its Covered\nEntity status the following non-covered functions: (1) non-health care components of\nthe organization, e.g., the University\u2019s academic programs, and/or (2) health care\ncomponents of the organization that do not engage in electronic transactions, e.g., a\nclinic that provides health care services but does not bill for its services. All UH\nCovered Components must comply with HIPAA. Furthermore, to the extent that any\nUniversity Unit is required to enter into a BAA and/or Subcontractor Agreement, as\ndefined in HIPAA, such Unit will also be subject to HIPAA and designated as a UH\nCovered Component. The University may also designate other University Units as UH\nCovered Components to the extent that they perform a function and provide services for\na designated UH Covered Component, but are not themselves providing treatment,\npayment or health care operations, and are designated as Business Associates of a\ndesignated UH Covered Component.\nUniversity Units that are designated as UH Covered Components are listed on\nthe University\u2019s HIPAA Policy website: http://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/hipaa\nUniversity Units that collect, use, transmit, and/or store IIHI but are not\ndesignated as UH Covered Components are still required to: (1) protect IIHI in\naccordance with applicable HIPAA privacy and security policies and (2) comply with the\noperational procedures set forth herein.\nB. General Requirements and Practices\n1. The designated UH Covered Component may not share PHI with the non-\ncovered Units of the University unless specifically allowed by HIPAA and\nthis HIPAA Policy. Each UH Covered Component shall comply with\nHIPAA and require its employees, students, volunteers, consultants, and\ncontractors to comply with HIPAA and this HIPAA Policy. A UH Covered\nComponent may not modify or delete any portion of this HIPAA Policy.\n2. Each UH Covered Component has performed a risk assessment as\nrequired by HIPAA that shows compliance with HIPAA and this HIPAA\nPolicy.\n3. Each UH Covered Component must designate a Unit HIPAA Coordinator\nto assist the UH System HIPAA Privacy and Security Officer(s) in carrying\nout this HIPAA Policy and all University policies and procedures related to\nthe privacy and security of PHI and ePHI under HIPAA.\nEP 2.217\nPage 7 of 25\n4. The appropriate Unit employees, students and volunteers of each\ndesignated UH Covered Component have satisfactorily completed training\nrequired by HIPAA and any updates to training as required by HIPAA.\n5. Each UH Covered Component has a BAA with another internal University\nUnit or an entity outside the University to share PHI or a Limited Data Set.\n6. Each UH Covered Component that provides a Limited Data Set pursuant\nto HIPAA to another University Unit or an entity outside the University has\na current Data Use Agreement and BAA with such University Unit or\noutside entity that receives the Limited Data Set, and such use has been\napproved by the University\u2019s Institutional Review Board (\u201cIRB\u201d).\n7. Each UH Covered Component provides and posts a Notice of Privacy\nPractices as required by HIPAA. (A standard University Notice of Privacy\nPractices template is attached hereto as Attachment 2.)\nC. Privacy Policies and Procedures\n1. Disclosure only with consent. A UH Covered Component may not use or\ndisclose PHI without the consent of the individual, except disclosures for\ntreatment, payment, or health care operations, and for certain incidental or\nlimited uses in compliance with HIPAA. 45 CFR \u00a7 164.502 and 164.506.\n2. Disclosure required to individual and DHHS. A UH Covered Component is\nrequired to disclose PHI to an individual when requested (45 CFR \u00a7\n164.524 or \u00a7164.528) and when required by the Secretary of the\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (\u201cDHHS\u201d) to investigate or\ndetermine the UH Covered Component\u2019s compliance with HIPAA.\n3. Disclosure to UH Covered Component. When using or disclosing PHI or\nwhen requesting PHI from another UH Covered Component, the UH\nCovered Component must make reasonable efforts to limit PHI use or\ndisclosure to the Minimum Necessary to accomplish the intended purpose\nof the use, disclosure, or request except as otherwise provided by HIPAA.\n4. Disclosure to Business Associate. A UH Covered Component may\ndisclose PHI to a business associate and may allow a business associate\nto create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI on its behalf, if the UH\nCovered Component obtains assurances that the business associate will\nappropriately safeguard the information. Such assurances must be\ndocumented through a BAA that complies with HIPAA. (Standard\nUniversity BAAs are attached hereto as Attachments 3-A (Unit is the\nCovered Entity) and 3-B (Unit is the Business Associate).)\n5. Disclosure pursuant to valid authorization. When a UH Covered\nComponent obtains or receives a valid authorization, use and disclosure\nof any PHI under such authorization must be consistent with such\nEP 2.217\nPage 8 of 25\nauthorization.\n6. Disclosure for marketing purposes. The UH Covered Component must\nobtain authorization for any use or disclosure of PHI for \u201cmarketing\u201d\npurposes, unless it is face-to-face communication between the UH\nCovered Component and the individual, or a promotional gift of nominal\nvalue provided by the UH Covered Component. Marketing is\ncommunication about a product or service which encourages recipients of\nthe communication to purchase or use the product or service, unless the\ncommunication is made:\na. to provide refill reminders or otherwise communicate about a drug or\nbiologic that is currently being prescribed for the individual, only if the\nfinancial remuneration received by the UH Covered Component in\nexchange for making the communication is reasonable in relation to\nthe UH Covered Component\u2019s costs of making the communication; or\nb. for the following purposes except where the UH Covered Component\nreceives financial remuneration in exchange for the communication:\n1) to describe a health\u2013related product or service (or payment for\nsuch product or service) that is provided by, or included in a plan of\nbenefits of, the covered entity making the communication (including\ncommunications about the entities participating in a health care\nprovider network or health plan network; replacement of, or\nenhancements to, a health plan; and health related products or\nservices available only to a health plan enrollee that add value to,\nbut are not part of, a plan of benefits);\n2) for treatment of the individual, including case management or care\ncoordination, or to direct or recommend alternative treatments,\ntherapies, health care providers, or settings of care to the\nindividual; or\n3) for case management or care coordination, contacting of individuals\nwith information about treatment alternatives and related functions\nto the extent that these activities do not fall within the definition of\ntreatment.\n7. Disclosure of psychotherapy notes. The UH Covered Component must\nobtain prior written authorization from the patient for any disclosure of\npsychotherapy notes for any reason (with limited exceptions).\na. Psychotherapy notes are notes recorded by a provider who is a mental\nhealth professional documenting or analyzing the contents of\nconversation during a private counseling session or a group, joint, or\nfamily counseling session and that are separated from the rest of the\nindividual\u2019s medical record. Psychotherapy notes exclude medication\nEP 2.217\nPage 9 of 25\nprescription and monitoring, counseling session start and stop times,\nthe modalities and frequencies of treatment furnished, results of clinical\ntests, and any summary of the following items: diagnosis, functional\nstatus, the treatment plan, symptoms, prognosis, and progress to date\nb. The UH Covered Component should always consult the applicable\nregulations for specific guidance on protecting psychotherapy notes.\nAny questions about compliance should be directed to the UH Covered\nComponent\u2019s Unit HIPAA Coordinator, or the UH System HIPAA\nPrivacy and Security Officer(s).\n8. Disclosure relating to minors. While HIPAA uses the terms \u201cemancipated\nminor\u201d and \u201cunemancipated minor,\u201d HIPAA defers to state law regarding\nthe disclosure of PHI relating to a minor. Accordingly, this paragraph\nIII.C.8 is based on HIPAA and applicable State law. The UH Covered\nComponent should always consult the applicable laws and regulations for\nspecific guidance on disclosure relating to minors. Any questions about\ncompliance should be directed to the UH Covered Component\u2019s Unit\nHIPAA Coordinator, or the UH System HIPAA Privacy and Security\nOfficer(s).\na. Relevant definitions.\n1) For purposes of this policy, a \u201cminor\u201d is generally any person under\nthe age of 18.\n2) \u201cEmancipated Minor\u201d is a minor (under 18) who is to be treated as\nan adult for purposes of this policy. Under this policy, an\nemancipated minor is\n(1) a minor who has been married and is thus considered to have\nreached the age of majority (18); or\n(2) a minor who is totally self-supporting.\n(This definition of Emancipated Minor incorporates both HIPAA and\napplicable state law.)\n3) \u201cPersonal Representative\u201d is a person with authority to act for the\nEmancipated Minor in making decisions related to health care. A\nPersonal Representative has the same powers as the Emancipated\nMinor to the extent allowed under applicable state law.\n4) A \u201cminor without support,\u201d is a person who is at least 14 but less\nthan 18 years of age, who is not under the care, supervision, or\ncontrol of a parent, custodian or legal guardian. Minors without\nsupport may consent to primary medical treatment and services\nunder certain circumstances. A minor without support who receives\nservices is deemed to have legal capacity to consent to such\ntreatment and such consent is binding as if the minor without\nsupport reached the age of majority. Because these provisions\ndeem a minor without support to have reached the age of majority,\nEP 2.217\nPage 10 of 25\nsuch a minor qualifies under HIPAA as the only person who can\nsign an Authorization for release of PHI.\n5) An \u201cunemancipated minor\u201d is a person under 18 years of age who\nis not an Emancipated Minor as defined above.\nb. Disclosure to a minor\u2019s parent, guardian, or person acting in lieu of a\nparent, i.e., Personal Representative, and Authorization by Personal\nRepresentative.\n1) A licensed health care professional may release PHI to a parent,\nguardian or person acting in lieu of a parent if (a) such release is\nallowed by state law and (b) approved by a licensed health care\nprofessional, in the exercise of professional judgment. See 45 CFR\n164.502(g)(3)(ii)(A)-(C).\n2) In situations where the parent, guardian or person acting in lieu of a\nparent of an unemancipated minor has the authority to act on\nbehalf of the minor as the minor\u2019s Personal Representative, and an\nAuthorization to use or disclose the minor\u2019s PHI is required, the\nAuthorization may be signed by the minor\u2019s Personal\nRepresentative.\nc. Disclosure requiring Authorization by the minor. If the minor has the\nauthority to act on his/her own behalf in receiving health care\nservices, e.g., an Emancipated Minor or a \u201cminor without support\u201d,\nthen the minor must sign his/her own Authorization and must\nauthorize disclosure of the minor\u2019s PHI.\nd. Disclosure (at the discretion of treating physician) requiring\nconsultation with the minor (ages 14 \u2013 17).\n1) Public and private hospitals, or public and private clinics or\nphysicians licensed to practice medicine, at the discretion of the\ntreating physician (excluding other care providers who are not\nphysicians, e.g., psychologists, advanced practice nurses, etc.),\nmay inform the spouse, parent, custodian, or guardian of any minor\npatient (ages 14 \u2013 17) of the provision of medical care and services\n(including the diagnosis, examination, and administration of\nmedication in the treatment of venereal diseases, pregnancy, and\nfamily planning services, but excluding surgery or any treatment to\ninduce abortion) to such minor patient or disclose any information\npertaining to such care and services after consulting with such\nminor patient to whom such medical care and services have been\nprovided. If the minor patient is not diagnosed as being pregnant or\nafflicted with venereal disease, the treating physician may disclose\nsuch information as well as the application for diagnosis, at the\ndiscretion of the treating physician after consulting with such minor\npatient.\n2) Written authorization is not required for such a disclosure since only\nconsultation is required. If the minor (ages 14 \u2013 17) is diagnosed as\nEP 2.217\nPage 11 of 25\npregnant or afflicted with venereal disease, the treating physician\nprobably cannot disclose such information to the parents or\nguardians without permission from such minor\n9. Disclosure requiring advance notice and opportunity to agree or object. A\nUH Covered Component may use or disclose PHI, provided that the\nindividual is informed in advance and has the opportunity to agree to or\nprohibit or restrict the use or disclosure in accordance with applicable\nHIPAA regulations (see 45 CFR \u00a7 164.510). The UH Covered Component\nmay verbally inform the individual of and obtain the individual's verbal\nagreement or objection to a use or disclosure permitted by the HIPAA\nregulations. If the individual is not present, or the opportunity to agree or\nobject to the use or disclosure cannot practicably be provided because of\nthe individual's incapacity or an emergency circumstance, the UH Covered\nComponent may, in the exercise of professional judgment, determine\nwhether the disclosure is in the best interests of the individual and, if so,\ndisclose only the PHI that is directly relevant to the individual's care or\npayment or that is needed for notification purposes. A UH Covered\nComponent may use professional judgment and its experience with\ncommon practice to make reasonable inferences of the individual's best\ninterest in allowing another person to act on behalf of the individual to pick\nup filled prescriptions, medical supplies, X-rays, or other similar forms of\nPHI.\n10. Disclosure when authorization or opportunity to agree or object not\nrequired.\na. A UH Covered Component may use or disclose PHI to the extent that\nsuch use or disclosure is required by law and the use or disclosure\ncomplies with and is limited to the relevant requirements of such law.\nb. A UH Covered Component may use or disclose PHI for the public\nhealth activities and purposes as provided in relevant HIPAA\nregulations (see 45 CFR \u00a7 164.512).\nc. A UH Covered Component may disclose PHI to a health oversight\nagency for oversight activities authorized by law, including audits;\ncivil, administrative, or criminal investigations; inspections; licensure\nor disciplinary actions; civil, administrative, or criminal proceedings or\nactions; or other activities necessary for appropriate oversight.\nd. A UH Covered Component may disclose PHI in the course of any\njudicial or administrative proceeding: (1) in response to an order of a\ncourt or administrative tribunal, provided that only the PHI expressly\nauthorized is disclosed, or (2) in response to a subpoena, discovery\nrequest or other lawful process.\ne. A UH Covered Component may disclose PHI for a law enforcement\npurpose to a law enforcement official if: (1) required by law or (2) in\nEP 2.217\nPage 12 of 25\ncompliance with court proceedings or administrative requests if\ninformation sought is relevant to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry,\nand de-identified information could not reasonably be used.\n11. Disclosure to determine identity or cause of death. A UH Covered\nComponent may disclose PHI to a coroner or medical examiner for the\npurpose of identifying a deceased person, determining a cause of death,\nor other duties as authorized by law.\n12. Disclosure for research purposes. A UH Covered Component may use or\ndisclose PHI for research, regardless of the source of funding of the\nresearch, provided that:\na. The UH Covered Component obtains documentation that an alteration\nto or waiver of the individual authorization for use or disclosure of PHI\nhas been approved by a University IRB.\nb. The UH Covered Component obtains from the researcher\nrepresentations that use or disclosure is solely to review PHI to\nprepare or advance research, and no PHI is removed from the UH\nCovered Component.\nc. A brief description of the PHI has been deemed to be necessary by the\nUniversity IRB.\nd. A statement that the alteration or waiver of authorization has been\nreviewed and approved, and signed by the chair or other member\n(designated by the chair) of the University IRB.\n13. Disclosure to prevent/lessen imminent threat of harm. A UH Covered\nComponent may, consistent with applicable law and standards of ethical\nconduct, use or disclose PHI, if it believes that the use or disclosure is\nnecessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health\nor safety of a person or the public, or necessary to law enforcement\nauthorities to identify or apprehend an individual.\n14. Disclosure for workers compensation purposes. A UH Covered\nComponent may disclose PHI as authorized by and to the extent\nnecessary to comply with laws relating to workers\u2019 compensation or other\nsimilar programs that provide benefit for work-related injuries or illness.\n15. Disclosure of de-identified data. Heath information is not IIHI if (1) it does\nnot identify an individual; and (2) there is no reasonable basis to believe\nthat the information can be used to identify an individual. Data which lack\nthese elements are excluded from the HIPAA regulations governing PHI\nuse. Such de-identified data must have the following identifiers removed:\na. Names.\nb. All geographic subdivisions smaller than a State, including street\naddress, city, county, precinct, zip code, and their equivalent\ngeocodes, except for the initial three digits of a zip code if, according to\nEP 2.217\nPage 13 of 25\nthe current publicly available data from the Bureau of the Census: (1)\nthe geographic unit formed by combining all zip codes with the same\nthree initial digits contains more than 20,000 people and (2) the initial\nthree digits of a zip code for all such geographic units containing\n20,000 or fewer people is changed to 000.\nc. All elements of dates (except year) for dates directly related to an\nindividual, including birth date, admission date, discharge date, date of\ndeath; and all ages over 89 and all elements of dates (including year)\nindicative of such age, except that such ages and elements may be\naggregated into a single category of age 90 or older.\nd.

A UH Covered Component must make the required notice available on\nrequest to any person and to individuals as specified.\nd. Requirements for electronic notice: A UH Covered Component that\nmaintains a website must make the notice prominently available on its\nwebsite. A UH Covered Component may provide notice via email if the\nindividual has agreed to such notice and other requirements of this\nsection are met.\nEP 2.217\nPage 15 of 25\ne. A UH Covered Component must document compliance with the notice\nrequirements, by retaining copies of the notices issued by the UH\nCovered Component and, if applicable, any written acknowledgements\nof receipt of the notice or documentation of good faith efforts to obtain\nsuch written acknowledgement.\nf.

Identity thieves may drain accounts, damage credit, and even put medical treatment at risk. The cost to business \u2014 left with unpaid bills racked up by scam artists \u2014 can be staggering, too.\nThe Red Flags Rule\n1\nrequires many businesses and organizations to implement a written identity theft prevention program designed to detect the \u201cred flags\u201d of identity theft in their day-to-day operations, take steps to prevent the crime, and mitigate its damage. The bottom line is that a program can help businesses spot suspicious patterns and prevent the costly consequences of identity theft.\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enforces the Red Flags Rule with several other agencies. This article has tips for organizations under FTC jurisdiction to determine whether they need to design an identity theft prevention program.\nTable of Contents\nAn Overview\nWho Must Comply with the Red Flags Rule\nFAQs\nHow To Comply: A Four-Step Process\nEndnotes\nAn Overview\nThe Red Flags Rule tells you how to develop, implement, and administer an identity theft prevention program.

Red Flags are suspicious patterns or practices, or specific activities that indicate the possibility of identity theft.\n3\nFor example, if a customer has to provide some form of identification to open an account with your company, an ID that doesn\u2019t look genuine is a \u201cred flag\u201d for your business.\nA program must be designed to detect the red flags you\u2019ve identified. If you have identified fake IDs as a red flag, for example, you must have procedures to detect possible fake, forged, or altered identification.\nA program must spell out appropriate actions you\u2019ll take take when you detect red flags.\nA program must detail how you\u2019ll keep it current to reflect new threats.\nJust getting something down on paper won\u2019t reduce the risk of\nidentity theft\n. That\u2019s why the Red Flags Rule has requirements on how to incorporate your program into the daily operations of your business. Fortunately, the Rule also gives you the flexibility to design a program appropriate for your company \u2014 its size and potential risks of identity theft. While some businesses and organizations may need a comprehensive program to address a high risk of identity theft, a streamlined program may be appropriate for businesses facing a low risk.\nSecuring the data you collect and maintain about customers is important in reducing identity theft. The Red Flags Rule seeks to prevent identity theft, too, by ensuring that your business or organization is on the lookout for the signs that a crook is using someone else\u2019s information, typically to get products or services from you without paying for them. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to use a one-two punch in the battle against identity theft: implement data security practices that make it harder for crooks to get access to the personal information they use to open or access accounts, and pay attention to the red flags that suggest that fraud may be afoot.\nWho Must Comply with the Red Flags Rule: A Two-Part Analysis\nThe Red Flags Rule requires \u201cfinancial institutions\u201d and some \u201ccreditors\u201d to conduct a periodic risk assessment to determine if they have \u201ccovered accounts.\u201d The determination isn\u2019t based on the industry or sector, but rather on whether a business\u2019 activities fall within the relevant definitions. A business must implement a written program\nonly\nif it has covered accounts.\nFinancial Institution\nThe Red Flags Rule defines a \u201cfinancial institution\u201d as a state or national bank, a state or federal savings and loan association, a mutual savings bank, a state or federal credit union, or a person that, directly or indirectly, holds a transaction account belonging to a consumer.\n4\nWhile many financial institutions are under the jurisdiction of the federal bank regulatory agencies or other federal agencies, state-chartered credit unions are one category of financial institution under the FTC\u2019s jurisdiction.\nCreditor\nThe Red Flags Rule defines \u201ccreditor\u201d based on conduct.\n5\nTo determine if your business is a creditor under the Red Flags Rule, ask these questions:\nDoes my business or organization regularly:\ndefer payment for goods and services or bill customers?\ngrant or arrange credit?\nparticipate in the decision to extend, renew, or set the terms of credit?\nIf you answer:\nNo to all, the Rule does not apply.\nYes to one or more, ask:\nDoes my business or organization regularly and in the ordinary course of business:\nget or use consumer reports in connection with a credit transaction?\ngive information to credit reporting companies in connection with a credit transaction?\nadvance funds to \u2014 or for \u2014 someone who must repay them, either with funds or pledged property (excluding incidental expenses in connection with the services you provide to them)?\nIf you answer:\nNo to all, the Rule does not apply.\nYes to one or more, you are a creditor covered by the Rule.\nCovered Accounts\nIf you conclude that your business or organization is a financial institution or a creditor covered by the Rule, you must determine if you have any \u201ccovered accounts,\u201d as the Red Flags Rule defines that term. You\u2019ll need to look at existing accounts\nand\nnew ones\n6\n.  Two categories of accounts are covered:\nA consumer account for your customers for personal, family, or household purposes that involves or allows multiple payments or transactions.\n7\nExamples are credit card accounts, mortgage loans, automobile loans, checking accounts, and savings accounts.\n\u201cAny other account that a financial institution or creditor offers or maintains for which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk to customers or to the safety and soundness of the financial institution or creditor from identity theft, including financial, operational, compliance, reputation, or litigation risks.\u201d\n8\nExamples include small business accounts, sole proprietorship accounts, or single transaction consumer accounts that may be vulnerable to identity theft. Unlike consumer accounts designed to allow multiple payments or transactions \u2014 always considered \u201ccovered accounts\u201d under the Rule \u2014 other types of accounts are \u201ccovered\u201d only if the risk of identity theft is reasonably foreseeable.\nIn determining if accounts are covered under the second category, consider how they\u2019re opened and accessed. For example, there may be a reasonably foreseeable risk of identity theft in connection with business accounts that can be accessed remotely \u2014 say, through the Internet or the telephone. Your risk analysis must consider any actual incidents of identity theft involving accounts like these.\nIf you don\u2019t have any covered accounts, you don\u2019t need a written program. But business models and services change. You may acquire covered accounts through changes to your business structure, process, or organization. That\u2019s why it\u2019s good policy and practice to conduct a periodic risk assessment.\nFAQs\nI review credit reports to screen job applicants. Does the Rule apply to my business on this basis alone?\nNo, the Rule does not apply because the use is not \u201cin connection with a credit transaction.\u201d\nWhat if I\noccasionally\nget credit reports in connection with credit transactions?\nAccording to the Rule, these activities must be done \u201cregularly and in the ordinary course of business.\u201d Isolated conduct does not trigger application of the Rule, but if your business regularly furnishes delinquent account information to a consumer reporting company but no other credit information, that satisfies the \u201cregularly and in the ordinary course of business\u201d prerequisite.\nWhat is deemed \u201cregularly and in the ordinary course of business\u201d is specific to individual companies. If you get consumer reports or furnish information to a consumer reporting company regularly and in the ordinary course of your particular business, the Rule applies, even if for others in your industry it isn\u2019t a regular practice or part of the ordinary course of business.\nI am a professional who bills my clients for services at the end of the month. Am I a creditor just because I allow clients to pay later?\nNo. Deferring payment for goods or services, payment of debt, or the purchase of property or services alone doesn\u2019t constitute \u201cadvancing funds\u201d under the Rule.\nIn my business, I lend money to customers for their purchases. The loans are backed by title to their car. Is this considered \u201cadvancing funds\u201d?\nYes. Anyone who lends money \u2014 like a payday lender or automobile title lender \u2014 is covered by the Rule. Their lending activities may make their business attractive targets for identity theft. But deferring the payment of debt or the purchase of property or services alone doesn\u2019t constitute \u201cadvancing funds.\u201d\nI offer instant credit to my customers and contract with another company to pull credit reports to determine their creditworthiness. No one in our organization ever sees the credit reports. Is my business covered by the Rule\n?\nYes. Your business is \u2014 regularly and in the ordinary course of business \u2014 using credit reports in connection with a credit transaction. The Rule applies whether your business uses the reports directly or whether a third-party evaluates them for you.\nI operate a finance company that helps people buy furniture. Does the Rule apply to my business?\nYes. Your company\u2019s financing agreements are considered to be \u201cadvancing funds on behalf of a person.\u201d\nIn my legal practice, I often make copies and pay filing, court, or expert fees for my clients. Am I \u201cadvancing funds\u201d?\nNo. This is not the same as a commercial lender making a loan; \u201cadvancing funds\u201d does not include paying in advance for fees, materials, or services that are incidental to providing another service that someone requested.\nOur company is a \u201ccreditor\u201d under the Rule and we have credit and non-credit accounts. Do we have to determine if both types of accounts are \u201ccovered accounts\u201d?\nYes. You must examine all your accounts to determine which are \u201ccovered accounts\u201d that must be included in your written identity theft prevention program.\nMy business accepts credit cards for payments. Are we covered by the Red Flags Rule on this basis alone?\nNo. Just accepting credit cards as a form of payment does not make you a \u201ccreditor\u201d under the Red Flags Rule.\nMy business isn\u2019t subject to much of a risk that a crook is going to misuse someone\u2019s identity to steal from me, but it does have covered accounts. How should I structure my program?\nIf identity theft isn\u2019t a big risk in your business, complying with the Rule is simple and straightforward. For example, if the risk of identity theft is low, your program might focus on how to respond if you are notified \u2014 say, by a customer or a law enforcement officer \u2014 that someone\u2019s identity was misused at your business. The Guidelines to the Rule have examples of possible responses. But even a business at low risk needs a written program that is approved either by its board of directors or an appropriate senior employee.\nHow To Comply: A Four-Step Process\nMany companies already have plans and policies to combat identity theft and related fraud. If that\u2019s the case for your business, you\u2019re already on your way to full compliance.\n1. Identify Relevant Red Flags\nWhat are \u201cred flags\u201d? They\u2019re the potential patterns, practices, or specific activities indicating the possibility of identity theft.\n9\nConsider:\nRisk Factors\n. Different types of accounts pose different kinds of risk. For example, red flags for deposit accounts may differ from red flags for credit accounts, and those for consumer accounts may differ from those for business accounts. When you are identifying key red flags, think about the types of accounts you offer or maintain; the ways you open covered accounts; how you provide access to those accounts; and what you know about identity theft in your business.\nSources of Red Flags.\nConsider other sources of information, including the experience of other members of your industry. Technology and criminal techniques change constantly, so it\u2019s important to keep up-to-date on new threats.\nCategories of Common Red Flags.\nSupplement A to the Red Flags Rule lists specific categories of warning signs to consider including in your program. The examples here are one way to think about relevant red flags in the context of your own business.\nAlerts, Notifications, and Warnings from a Credit Reporting Company\n. Changes in a credit report or a consumer\u2019s credit activity might signal identity theft:\na fraud or active duty alert on a credit report\na notice of credit freeze in response to a request for a credit report\na notice of address discrepancy provided by a credit reporting company\na credit report indicating a pattern inconsistent with the person\u2019s history B for example, an increase in the volume of inquiries or the use of credit, especially on new accounts; an unusual number of recently established credit relationships; or an account that was closed because of an abuse of account privileges\nSuspicious Documents\n. Documents can offer hints of identity theft:\nidentification looks altered or forged\nthe person presenting the identification doesn\u2019t look like the photo or match the physical description\ninformation on the identification differs from what the person with identification is telling you or doesn\u2019t match a signature card or recent check\nan application looks like it\u2019s been altered, forged, or torn up and reassembled\nPersonal Identifying Information\n. Personal identifying information can indicate identity theft:\ninconsistencies with what you know \u2014 for example, an address that doesn\u2019t match the credit report or the use of a Social Security number that\u2019s listed on the Social Security Administration Death Master File\ninconsistencies in the information a customer has submitted to you\nan address, phone number, or other personal information already used on an account you know to be fraudulent\na bogus address, an address for a mail drop or prison, a phone number that\u2019s invalid, or one that\u2019s associated with a pager or answering service\na Social Security number used by someone else opening an account\nan address or telephone number used by several people opening accounts\na person who omits required information on an application and doesn\u2019t respond to notices that the application is incomplete\na person who can\u2019t provide authenticating information beyond what\u2019s generally available from a wallet or credit report \u2014 for example, someone who can\u2019t answer a challenge question\nAccount Activity\n. How the account is being used can be a tip-off to identity theft:\nshortly after you\u2019re notified of a change of address, you\u2019re asked for new or additional credit cards, or to add users to the account\na new account used in ways associated with fraud \u2014 for example, the customer doesn\u2019t make the first payment, or makes only an initial payment; or most of the available credit is used for cash advances or for jewelry, electronics, or other merchandise easily convertible to cash\nan account used outside of established patterns \u2014 for example, nonpayment when there\u2019s no history of missed payments, a big increase in the use of available credit, or a major change in buying or spending patterns or electronic fund transfers\nan account that is inactive is used again\nmail sent to the customer that is returned repeatedly as undeliverable although transactions continue to be conducted on the account\ninformation that the customer isn\u2019t receiving an account statement by mail or email\ninformation about unauthorized charges on the account\nNotice from Other Sources.\nA customer, a victim of identity theft, a law enforcement authority, or someone else may be trying to tell you that an account has been opened or used fraudulently.\n2. Detect Red Flags\nSometimes, using identity verification and authentication methods can help you detect red flags. Consider whether your procedures should differ if an identity verification or authentication is taking place in person, by telephone, mail, or online.\nNew accounts.\nWhen verifying the identity of the person who is opening a new account, reasonable procedures may include getting a name, address, and identification number and, for in-person verification, checking a current government-issued identification card, like a driver\u2019s license or passport. Depending on the circumstances, you may want to compare that to information you can find out from other sources, like a credit reporting company or data broker, or the Social Security Number Death Master File.\n10\nAsking questions based on information from other sources can be a helpful way to verify someone\u2019s identity.\nExisting accounts.\nTo detect red flags for existing accounts, your program may include reasonable procedures to confirm the identity of the person you\u2019re dealing with, to monitor transactions, and to verify the validity of change-of-address requests. For online authentication, consider the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council\u2019s guidance on authentication as a starting point.\n11\nIt explores the application of multi-factor authentication techniques in high-risk environments, including using passwords, PINs, smart cards, tokens, and biometric identification. Certain types of personal information \u2014 like a Social Security number, date of birth, mother\u2019s maiden name, or mailing address \u2014 are not reliable authenticators because they\u2019re so easily accessible.\nYou may be using programs to monitor transactions, identify behavior that indicates the possibility of fraud and identity theft, or validate changes of address. If so, incorporate these tools into your program.\n3. Prevent And Mitigate Identity Theft\nWhen you spot a red flag, be prepared to respond appropriately. Your response will depend on the degree of risk posed. It may need to accommodate other legal obligations, like laws about providing and terminating service.\nThe Guidelines in the Red Flags Rule offer examples of some appropriate responses, including:\nmonitoring a covered account for evidence of identity theft\ncontacting the customer\nchanging passwords, security codes, or other ways to access a covered account\nclosing an existing account\nreopening an account with a new account number\nnot opening a new account\nnot trying to collect on an account or not selling an account to a debt collector\nnotifying law enforcement\ndetermining that no response is warranted under the particular circumstances\nThe facts of a particular case may warrant using one of these options, several of them, or another response altogether. Consider whether any aggravating factors raise the risk of identity theft. For example, a recent breach that resulted in unauthorized access to a customer\u2019s account records would call for a stepped-up response because the risk of identity theft rises, too.\n4. Update The Program\nThe Rule recognizes that new red flags emerge as technology changes or identity thieves change their tactics, and requires periodic updates to your program. Factor in your own experience with identity theft; changes in how identity thieves operate; new methods to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft; changes in the accounts you offer; and changes in your business, like mergers, acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures, and arrangements with service providers.\nAdministering Your Program\nYour Board of Directors \u2014 or an appropriate committee of the Board \u2014 must approve your initial plan.  If you don\u2019t have a board, someone in senior management must approve it.  The Board may oversee, develop, implement, and administer the program \u2014 or it may designate a senior employee to do the job. Responsibilities include assigning specific responsibility for the program\u2019s implementation, reviewing staff reports about compliance with the Rule, and approving important changes to your program.\nThe Rule requires that you train relevant staff only as \u201cnecessary.\u201d Staff who have taken fraud prevention training may not need to be re-trained. Remember that employees at many levels of your organization can play a key role in identity theft deterrence and detection.\nIn administering your program, monitor the activities of your service providers. If they\u2019re conducting activities covered by the Rule \u2014 for example, opening or managing accounts, billing customers, providing customer service, or collecting debts \u2014 they must apply the same standards you would if you were performing the tasks yourself. One way to make sure your service providers are taking reasonable steps is to add a provision to your contracts that they have procedures in place to detect red flags and either report them to you or respond appropriately to prevent or mitigate the crime. Other ways to monitor your service providers include giving them a copy of your program, reviewing the red flag policies, or requiring periodic reports about red flags they have detected and their response.\nIt\u2019s likely that service providers offer the same services to a number of client companies. As a result, the Guidelines are flexible about service providers using their own programs as long as they meet the requirements of the Rule.\nThe person responsible for your program should report at least annually to your Board of Directors or a designated senior manager. The report should evaluate how effective your program has been in addressing the risk of identity theft; how you\u2019re monitoring the practices of your service providers; significant incidents of identity theft and your response; and recommendations for major changes to the program.\n12\nFTC Resources\nIdentity Theft\nftc.gov/idtheft\nEndnotes\n1 The Red Flags Rule was issued in 2007 under Section 114 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction Act of 2003 (FACT Act), Pub.

The term \u201ctransaction\u201d is defined in section 19(b) of the Federal Reserve Act. See 12 U.S.C. ' 461(b)(1)(C). A \u201ctransaction account\u201d is a deposit or account from which owners may make payments or transfers to third parties or others.

        "article_text": "FAQs on Photos and Videos under FERPA\n1. When is a photo or video of a student an education record under FERPA?\nAs with any other \u201ceducation record,\u201d a photo or video of a student is an education record, subject to specific exclusions, when the photo or video is:  (1) directly related to a student; and (2) maintained by an educational agency or institution or by a party acting for the agency or institution. (20 U.S.C. 1232g(a)(4)(A); 34 CFR \u00a7 99.3 \u201cEducation Record\u201d)\n[1]\nDirectly Related to a Student:\nFERPA regulations do not define what it means for a record to be \u201cdirectly related\u201d to a student. In the context of photos and videos, determining if a visual representation of a student is\ndirectly\nrelated to a student (rather than just incidentally related to him or her) is often context-specific, and educational agencies and institutions should examine certain types of photos and videos on a case by case basis to determine if they directly relate to any of the students depicted therein. Among the factors that may help determine if a photo or video should be considered \u201cdirectly related\u201d to a student are the following:\nThe educational agency or institution uses the photo or video for disciplinary action (or other official purposes) involving the student (including the victim of any such disciplinary incident);\nThe photo or video contains a depiction of an activity:\nthat resulted in an educational agency or institution\u2019s use of the photo or video for disciplinary action (or other official purposes) involving a student (or, if disciplinary action is pending or has not yet been taken, that would reasonably result in use of the photo or video for disciplinary action involving a student);\nthat shows a student in violation of local, state, or federal law;\nthat shows a student getting injured, attacked, victimized, ill, or having a health emergency;\nThe person or entity taking the photo or video intends to make a specific student the focus of the photo or video (e.g., ID photos, or a recording of a student presentation); or\nThe audio or visual content of the photo or video otherwise contains personally identifiable information contained in a student\u2019s education record.\nA photo or video should not be considered directly related to a student in the absence of these factors and if the student\u2019s image is incidental or captured only as part of the background, or if a student is shown participating in school activities that are open to the public and without a specific focus on any individual.\nExamples of situations that may cause a video to be an education record:\nA school surveillance video showing two students fighting in a hallway, used as part of a disciplinary action, is directly related to the students fighting.\nA classroom video that shows a student having a seizure is directly related to that student because the depicted health emergency becomes the focus of the video.\nIf a school maintains a close-up photo of two or three students playing basketball with a general view of student spectators in the background, the photo is directly related to the basketball players because they are the focus of the photo, but it is not directly related to the students pictured in the background. Schools often designate photos or videos of students participating in public events (e.g., sporting events, concerts, theater performances, etc.) as directory information and/or obtain consent from the parents or eligible students to publicly disclose photos or videos from these events.\nA video recording of a faculty meeting during which a specific student\u2019s grades are being discussed is directly related to that student because the discussion contains PII from the student\u2019s education record.\nMaintained by an educational agency or institution:\nTo be considered an education record under FERPA, an educational agency or institution, or a party acting for the agency or institution, also must maintain the record. Thus, a photo taken by a parent at a school football game would not be considered an education record, even if it is directly related to a particular student, because it is not being maintained by the school or on the school\u2019s behalf. If, however, the parent\u2019s photo shows two students fighting at the game, and the parent provides a copy of the photo to the school, which then maintains the photo in the students\u2019 disciplinary records, then the copy of the photo being maintained by the school is an education record.\nExclusion for Law Enforcement Unit Records\nThe FERPA statute and regulations (20 U.S.C. 1232g(a)(4)(B)(ii) and 34 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 99.3 and 99.8) exclude from the definition of education records those records created and maintained by a law enforcement unit of an educational agency or institution for a law enforcement purpose. Thus, if a law enforcement unit of an educational agency or institution creates and maintains the school\u2019s surveillance videos for a law enforcement purpose, then any such videos would not be considered to be education records. If the law enforcement unit provides a copy of the video to another component within the educational agency or institution (for example, to maintain the record in connection with a disciplinary action), then the copy of the video may become an education record of the student(s) involved if the video is not subject to any other exclusion from the definition of \u201ceducation records\u201d and the video is:  (1) directly related to a student; and (2) maintained by an educational agency or institution or by a party acting for the agency or institution.\n2. Can the same recorded image be the education record of more than one student under FERPA?\nYes. For example, a surveillance video that shows two students fighting on a school bus that the school uses and maintains to discipline the two students, would be \u201cdirectly related to\u201d and, therefore, the education record of both students.\n3. If a video is an education record for multiple students, can a parent of one of the students or the eligible student view the video?\nWhen a video is an education record of multiple students, in general, FERPA requires the educational agency or institution to allow, upon request, an individual parent of a student (or the student if the student is an eligible student) to whom the video directly relates to inspect and review, or \"be informed of\" the content of the video, consistent with the FERPA statutory provisions in 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(a)(1)(A) and regulatory provisions at 34 CFR \u00a7 99.12(a). FERPA generally does not require the educational agency or institution to release copies of the video to the parent or eligible student.\nIn providing access to the video, the educational agency or institution must provide the parent of the student (or the student if the student is an eligible student) with the opportunity to inspect and review or \"be informed of\" the content of the video. If the educational agency or institution can reasonably redact or segregate out the portions of the video directly related to other students, without destroying the meaning of the record, then the educational agency or institution would be required to do so prior to providing the parent or eligible student with access. On the other hand, if redaction or segregation of the video cannot reasonably be accomplished, or if doing so would destroy the meaning of the record, then the parents of each student to whom the video directly relates (or the students themselves if they are eligible students) would have a right under FERPA to inspect and review or \"be informed of\" the entire record even though it also directly relates to other students.\nFor a fuller legal analysis and explanation of this issue, please see the\n2017 Letter to Wachter\n.\n4. If a video is an education record for multiple students, can the parent of one of the students (or the eligible student) receive a copy of the video?\nWhile we do not advise on an educational agency\u2019s or institution\u2019s obligations under any state open records laws that may apply, we note that FERPA does not generally require an educational agency or institution to provide copies of education records to parents and eligible students\n[2]\n. That said, it would not violate FERPA for an educational agency or institution to non-consensually disclose to an eligible student or to his or her parents copies of education records that the eligible student or his or her parents otherwise would have the right to inspect and review under FERPA.\nFor a fuller legal analysis and explanation of this issue, please see the\n2017 Letter to Wachter\n.\n5. If redaction or segregation of an education record of multiple students can be reasonably accomplished without destroying the meaning of the education record, can educational agencies and institutions charge parents or eligible students for the costs of the redaction or segregation?\nNo. FERPA provides parents and eligible students with the right to inspect and review the student\u2019s education records, and nothing in the FERPA statute or regulations permits educational agencies and institutions to charge parents or eligible students for fees or costs associated with exercising that right.\nIf a school elects to provide a parent or eligible student with a copy of the education records, then the FERPA regulations (34 CFR \u00a7 99.11(a)) generally permit (with the exception noted below) the school to charge for the costs required to make the copy. FERPA regulations (34 CFR \u00a7 99.11(b)) also provide that the school may not charge a parent or eligible student for the costs to search for or retrieve the education records. We view the costs, if any, to the school of redacting, or segregating, education records of multiple students as being like the costs of search and retrieval that may not be charged to parents or eligible students, rather than like the costs for copies that generally may be charged to parents and eligible students. As noted above, if an educational agency or institution can reasonably redact or segregate out portions of an education record that is directly related to other students, without destroying the meaning of the record, then the educational agency or institution must do so and therefore cannot charge parents or eligible students for the costs associated with exercising their right to inspect and review such education records.\nIn contrast, parents and eligible students generally may be charged for the costs of making copies of education records precisely because FERPA generally does not require the school to provide them with such copies. Thus, where the redaction or segregation of education records of multiple students can be reasonably accomplished without destroying the meaning of the education records, nothing in FERPA permits educational agencies or institutions to charge parents or eligible students for the costs of making the required redactions or segregation. Please note that the FERPA regulations (34 CFR \u00a7 99.11(a)) similarly provide that if a fee for copies effectively prevents a parent or an eligible student from exercising the right to inspect and review his or her education records, an educational agency or institution would be required to provide copies without payment. Such cases would be limited to a parent or an eligible student providing evidence of the inability to pay for the copies due to financial hardship.\n6. Does FERPA permit legal representatives of parents or eligible students to inspect and review videos with the parent or eligible student?\nYes. FERPA permits legal representatives of a parent or an eligible student to inspect and review videos with the parent or eligible student. While FERPA does not require educational agencies and institutions to allow parents or eligible students to bring their attorney or other legal representative with them when they exercise their right to inspect and review the student\u2019s education records, nothing in FERPA prevents educational agencies and institutions from allowing parents or eligible students to bring their attorney or other legal representative with them when they exercise their right to inspect and review the student\u2019s education records under FERPA.\n7. Does FERPA permit educational agencies and institutions turn over videos to the police upon request or following an incident that may warrant police involvement?\nIf the law enforcement unit of an educational agency or institution creates and maintains videos for a law enforcement purpose, then the videos would not be education records and FERPA would not prohibit the law enforcement unit of an educational agency or institution from disclosing the videos to the police. If the videos are education records, however, educational agencies and institutions may not turn over videos to the police upon request without having first either obtained the written consent of the parent or eligible student or determined that the conditions of an exception to the general requirement of consent have been met, such as if the disclosure is made in connection with a health or safety emergency (20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)(I) and 34 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 99.31(a)(10) and 99.36) or the law enforcement officer has presented the educational agency or institution with a judicial order or a lawfully issued subpoena (20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)(J) and (b)(2) and 34 CFR \u00a7 99.31(a)(9)).\n[1]\nThe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) also contains privacy protections that apply to children with disabilities. 20 U.S.C. 1417(c) and 34 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 300.610-300.626 and 34 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 303.401-303.416. Under the IDEA, participating agencies must protect the personally identifiable information (PII), data, or records that are collected, maintained, or used by the participating agency. While the definition of \u201ceducation record\u201d under Part B of the IDEA cross-references the FERPA definition in 34 CFR \u00a7 99.3, the application of IDEA requirements may raise different questions.\n[2]\nIf circumstances effectively prevent the parent or eligible student from otherwise exercising their right to inspect and review the student\u2019s education records (e.g., if the parent lives outside of commuting distance to the school), then the educational agency or institution would be required to either provide a copy of the records or to make other arrangements for the parent or eligible student to inspect and review the records. 34 CFR \u00a7 99.10(d)\nAudience:\nK-12 School Officials\nParents and Students\nPostsecondary School Officials\nTopics:\nPhotos and Videos under FERPA A Parent Guide to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act or FERPA provides certain rights for parents regarding their children\u2019s education records. This guide provides general information on a parent\u2019s rights under FERPA. An Eligible Student Guide to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act or FERPA provides certain rights for parents regarding their children\u2019s education records. When a student reaches 18 years of age or attends an institution of postsecondary education at any age, the student becomes an \u201celigible student,\u201d and all rights under FERPA transfer from the parent to the student. This guide provides general information on an eligible student\u2019s rights under FERPA. Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA) General Guidance\nThis guidance document reviews parents\u2019 rights under the PPRA and education officials\u2019 obligations in implementing the PPRA.  The PPRA applies to the programs and activities of a State educational agency (SEA), local educational agency (LEA), or other recipient of funds under any program funded by the U.S. Department of Education.

<li>Establish a set of standardized terms and definitions to promote consistent interpretations and implementations of policies, procedures, and practices related to data management.</li></ol>
</div>
<br class="screenOnly" /><h2>
   II. Definitions
</h2>
<div>
   <h3 id="II"></h3><ol><li>“Data Sharing Request Process” – A process that governs the release of Institutional Data and provides an understanding of how the data is being used, by whom, and where it is being copied and stored.</li><br />
<li>“Data Users” – All UH employees, students, and affiliates who, in order to fulfill their job duties and responsibilities, require access to UH Institutional Data.</li><br />
<li>“Departmental/Unit/Local Data Repositories” – Various UH academic and administrative departments or units copy Institutional Data from Institutional Data Systems into their own departmental, unit, or local data repositories. Any Departmental/Unit/Local Data Repository that contains a copy of Institutional Data are subject to the same policies and procedures which govern the use of Institutional Data.&nbsp; This policy applies to all repositories of Institutional Data, irrespective of where the repository is maintained (for example, a department may contract for cloud storage services to maintain its data repository).</br><br />
“Departmental/Unit/Local Data Repositories” – Various UH academic and administrative departments or units copy Institutional Data from Institutional Data Systems into their own departmental, unit, or local data repositories. Any Departmental/Unit/Local Data Repository that contains a copy of Institutional Data are subject to the same policies and procedures which govern the use of Institutional Data.&nbsp; This policy applies to all repositories of Institutional Data, irrespective of where the repository is maintained (for example, a department may contract for cloud storage services to maintain its data repository).</li><br />
<li>“Institutional Data” – Data elements which are created, received, maintained and/or transmitted by the University of Hawai‘i in the course of meeting its administrative and academic requirements.<br />
Institutional Data may be</br><br />
<ol><li>contained in any form, including but not limited to documents, databases, spreadsheets, email, and websites;</li><br />
<li>represented in any form, including but not limited to letters, numbers, words, pictures, videos, sounds, symbols, or any combination thereof;</li><br />
<li>communicated in any form, including but not limited to handwriting, printing, photocopying, photographing, and web publishing; and</li><br />
<li>recorded upon any form, including but not limited to papers, maps, films, prints, discs, drives, memory sticks, and other information systems.</li></ol></li><br />
<li>“Institutional Data Systems” – UH systemwide data repositories that collect and store both transactional (operational) and reporting types of Institutional Data, including Systems of Record. In some cases, Institutional Data may be purged on a regular basis from an Institutional Data System. Institutional Data Systems are subject to the same policies and procedures that govern the use of Institutional Data. Examples of Institutional Data Systems are the Banner Student Information System, PeopleSoft, Kuali Financial System, STAR, Laulima, etc.</br><br />
A list of Institutional Data Systems and associated System Executive Data Stewards is available on the UH data governance website. Note the list is not intended to be all-inclusive of the University’s Institutional Data Systems, but rather, represents Institutional Data Systems that are most likely to contain Protected Data.</li><br />
<li>“Protected Data” – Institutional Data that are subject to security and privacy considerations that range from moderate to very high (i.e., all non-public data). These data fall under the Institutional Data Classification Categories of “restricted,” “sensitive,” and “regulated.” For more information, refer to Executive Policy <a href="http://hawaii.edu/policy/ep2.214">EP 2.214, Institutional Data Classification Categories and Information Security Guidelines</a>.</li><br />
<li>“System of Record” – Institutional Data that are designated by a Data Steward as representing official values of the University. Official values are the data designated as the most accurate representation of the meaning and context of Institutional Data elements, which are recorded as facts. Official values are not necessarily the originally entered values, and as such, a System of Record may not necessarily be the system where values are originally entered. When questions arise over the meaning or interpretation of data elements or their values, the System of Record is used to resolve discrepancies.</li></ol>

<br class="screenOnly" /><h2>
   III. Executive Policy
</h2>
<div>
   <ol><h3><li>POLICY STATEMENT</h3>The University holds itself accountable for the privacy and security of its Institutional Data and other data under its stewardship while keeping that data accessible for appropriate use. The data governance program strives to achieve this by fostering a culture of shared responsibility and active participation among members of the University community.</li><br />
<h3><li>GOALS</h3>The goals of data governance at the University are to:<br />
<br />
<ol><li>Protect the privacy and security of data and information under the stewardship of the University;</li><br />
<li>Support a culture of responsible data use for informed and actionable decision making;</li><br />
<li>Establish systemwide standards that enable holistic understanding of data across institutional boundaries;</li><br />
<li>Promote the efficient use of resources to meet the data and information needs of the University community;</li><br />
<li>Increase the University’s transparency and accountability to external stakeholders and the public by promoting access to relevant information.</li></ol></li><h3><li>SCOPE</h3>The scope of this institutional data governance policy applies to the following:<br />
<br />
<ol><li>Individuals employed by the University or any affiliates (including external agencies such as RCUH, Sodexo, third party vendors, etc.) with access to University-related data and information (i.e., Institutional Data);</li><br />
<li>All Institutional Data created, collected, analyzed, and reported on by UH units as part of their administrative and academic functions, regardless of where they are located and in what medium they are stored (e.g., physical or electronic), how they are accessed, and how they are transmitted;</li><br />
<li>Institutional Data, such as student demographics, used in surveys or studies</li><br />
<li>Protected Data that has been created, collected, or analyzed for the purpose of research.</li></ol><br />
This policy recognizes the legal responsibilities of individual campuses to protect the privacy and security of their students’ data according to FERPA requirements.</li><h3><li>PRINCIPLES</h3>The following principles are set forth as minimum standards to govern the appropriate use and management of Institutional Data.<br />
<br />
<ol><li>Institutional Data is the property of the University of Hawai‘i and shall be managed as a key asset through defined governance standards, policies, and procedures.</li><br />
<li>Institutional Data will be safeguarded and protected according to security, privacy, and compliance rules and regulations established by the federal and state government (see <a href="#IB">section I-B</a>), and University of Hawai‘i policies. This University of Hawai‘i executive policy is not intended to supercede federal and state rules and regulations, but to promote and reinforce them.</li><br />
<li>Access to Institutional Data will be based on defined roles. Users deemed to have a legitimate educational interest will be assigned appropriate access based on their roles.</li><br />
<li>Institutional representatives will be held accountable to their roles and responsibilities. Roles and responsibilities involving the management and use of Institutional Data will be clearly defined, and individuals assigned to specific roles will be held accountable for their data management responsibilities.</li><br />
<li>The use, storage, and exposure of protected data will be minimized whenever possible.</li><br />
<li>The University strives to ensure the safety and security of its employees and its data assets. It will employ strategies in multiple ways, including the use of technology, physical space, etc. The strategies will take into consideration the privacy of individuals and the protection of data based on the level of sensitivity.</li><br />
<li>The University’s technical resources will be used for institutional purposes only and not for personal and/or private gain or for malicious intent.</li></ol></li><h3><li>BEST PRACTICES</h3><ol><li>Minimal access will be granted to Data Users. Individuals, including non-UH personnel (e.g., third party contractors), will be granted the most restrictive set of permissions and privileges based on feasibility and a need-to-know. Not only will the minimal level of access to perform an operation be granted, that access will be granted only for the duration of time necessary to complete the operation.</li><br />
<li>Disclosure of Institutional Data that are considered protected and personally identifiable will be based on a need to know. When possible, Institutional Data being disclosed will be de-identified.</li><br />
<li>Quality standards for Institutional Data will be defined, implemented, monitored, and communicated by System Executive Data Stewards of Institutional Data Systems (defined in sections <a href="#II">II, Definitions</a> and <a href="#IIIF">III-F, Roles and Responsibilities</a>). Examples of data quality standards include: data validation rules, timeliness of updates, defined error rates, etc.</li><br />
<li>Unnecessary duplication of Institutional Data is discouraged. Maintaining repositories of redundant data increases the risk of inadvertent disclosure or inappropriate access to Institutional Data. Executive Data Stewards and Data Custodians (defined in <a href="#IIIF">section III-F, Roles and Responsibilities</a>) will exercise responsible records management practices, including minimizing redundant storage where reasonable and appropriate.</li><br />
<li>Data Users will complete mandatory training requirements on the appropriate handling of Protected Data before they are allowed access. For more information, refer to <a href="http://hawaii.edu/policy/ap2.215">AP 2.215, Mandatory Training and Continuing Education Requirements for Data Users</a>.</li><br />
<li>Resolution of issues related to Institutional Data will follow consistent and public processes. The Data Governance Committee (DGC) will coordinate the resolution of issues related to risks, costs, access, management, and use of Institutional Data with the appropriate Data Stewards and with UH leadership.</li><br />
<li>Institutional Data will only be released for student surveys that are being administered for institutional purposes (such as improving services for students) and/or for the benefit students. Campuses make the final decision on which surveys student contact information will be released.</br><br />

Data Stewards are responsible for minimizing the use, storage, and exposure of Protected Data, particularly personally identifiable information. They are expected to limit the exposure of such data to only situations that are deemed essential and appropriate. <br />
<br />
There are two levels of Data Stewards at the University of Hawai‘i: executive and functional.<br />
<br />
<ol><li>Executive Data Stewards are accountable for the use and management of Institutional Data at their respective campus or within the Institutional Data System under their purview.<br />
<br />
<ol><li>Campus Executive Data Stewards<br />
<br />
<ol><li>These Data Stewards are vice chancellors or appropriate administrators responsible for the major functional areas within a campus including, but not limited to, student affairs, academic affairs, and administration. They have the authority to govern the use of Institutional Data within their respective areas.</li><br />
<li>Campus Executive Data Stewards for student data have the responsibility of reviewing and approving data sharing requests within their respective campuses. As part of the review process, a Campus Executive Data Steward will notify relevant parties of data sharing requests for student-related data through an inclusive and open communication process. Human resource and financial data sharing requests are managed centrally by the UH System Offices of Human Resources and Financial Management.</li></ol></li><br />
<li>System Executive Data Stewards<br />
<br />
<ol><li>These Data Stewards are primarily system level executives with functional responsibility for Institutional Data Systems (see <a href="#II">section II, Definitions</a>). They have the authority to govern the use of Institutional Data within these Institutional Data Systems.</li><br />
<li>System Executive Data Stewards review and approve Data Sharing Requests involving multiple campuses, external parties, and/or electronic linkages to Institutional Data Systems.

<li>System Executive Data Stewards have the additional responsibility of responding to the data and information needs of the University community through the Institutional Data Systems they oversee. They sponsor and promote a shared understanding of data through clear data element definitions, and oversee data quality and performance improvements within these systems.</li></ol></li></ol><br />
Refer to the UH Data Governance website for a listing of Institutional Data Systems and associated Executive Data Stewards.</li><br />
<li>Functional Data Stewards are responsible for the day-to-day use, management, and distribution of Institutional Data. Functional Data Stewards exist among all levels and across all units within the University. Registrars, financial aid officers, fiscal managers, human resources specialists, and institutional researchers are among those considered Data Stewards. <br />
<br />
Functional Data Stewards engage in the following types of data related activities:<br />
<br />
<ol><li>Ensure Institutional Data is managed appropriately, according to policies and procedures;</li><br />
<li>Recommend enhancements for their respective program areas to improve data quality, access, security, performance, and reporting;</li><br />
<li>Serve as a conduit between functional and technical personnel to promote communication and a shared understanding of requirements;</li><br />

<li>Data Custodians – Data Custodians are the managers and/or administrators of systems or media on which protected data reside, including, but not limited to, personal computers, laptop computers, PDAs, smartphones, departmental servers, enterprise databases, storage systems, magnetic tapes, CDs/DVDs, USB drives, paper files, and any other removable or portable devices or off-site storage technologies. These may include, but are not limited to, cloud storage or cloud services. Information technology personnel are commonly regarded as Data Custodians, however, any authorized individual who downloads or stores sensitive information onto a computer or other storage device becomes a Data Custodian through that act.<br />
<br />
Data Custodians are responsible for the technical safeguarding of protected data, including implementing and administering controls that ensure the transmission of those protected data are secure and access controls are in place to prevent inappropriate disclosure. This can be as simple as utilizing <a href="https://www.hawaii.edu/filedrop/">UH FileDrop</a> to transfer Protected Data.</li><br />
<li>Data Users – UH employees, students, and affiliates who, in order to fulfill their job duties and responsibilities, require access to protected data as defined in Executive Policy <a href="http://hawaii.edu/policy/ep2.214">EP 2.214, Institutional Data Classification Categories and Information Security Guidelines</a>. Data Users are responsible for understanding and complying with applicable University policies and procedures and all recognized federal and state laws for dealing with protected data.</br><br />
To ensure compliance and to meet the objectives of this policy, individuals must complete training requirements as outlined in <a href="http://hawaii.edu/policy/ap2.215">AP 2.215, Mandatory Training and Continuing Education Requirements for Data Users</a>. Those who do not comply will be denied access. Specific questions about the appropriate handling or usage of Institutional Data should be directed to the Executive Data Steward responsible for that area.</li></ol></li></ol>

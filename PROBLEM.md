there are some article that give me this {
"question": null,
"article_text": null
}

I want to get the article_text, but it is null, why?

The characters \xa0 represent a non-breaking space in Unicode, and \n represents a newline character. They are often found in HTML content and may not be desired in some cleaned text data, especially when preparing data for AI training.

To make the text even cleaner, we can modify the cleaning function to replace these characters:

Replace all occurrences of \xa0 with a regular space.
Replace all occurrences of multiple newline characters (\n\n, \n\n\n, etc.) with a single newline character to remove excessive line breaks.
